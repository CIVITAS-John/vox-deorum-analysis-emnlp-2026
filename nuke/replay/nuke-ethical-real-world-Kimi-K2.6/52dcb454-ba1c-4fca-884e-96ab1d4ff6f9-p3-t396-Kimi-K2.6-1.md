  - rationale: ETHIOPIA CULTURAL VICTORY IMMINENT: Ethiopia has INFLUENCED ALL 7 CIVS and reached Order:3. They need only adopt CEP tenet and build it to win immediately. Switching to CONQUEST grand strategy with maximum mobilization (100) and offense (95). Naval (95) and Airlift (80) priorities enable rapid amphibious assault on Ethiopian coastal cities (Lalibela, Axum, Gondar) to destroy CEP before construction. Espionage (90) to accelerate Salem rig for delegate, but military solution is primary. All economy/culture deprioritized - this is existential war.

  - system:
    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - You can ask your specialized briefers to prepare focused reports (only for) the next turn by calling the `focus-briefer` tool.
        - You have three specialized briefers: Military, Economy, and Diplomacy analysts.
        - Only ask for information relevant to the macro-level decisions in your control. 
       - Your briefer(s) ONLY have limited information of the current game state.
        - Your briefer(s) DO NOT have control over tactical decisions and cannot predict tactical AI's next decision.
        - Your briefer(s) ARE BEST on summarizing and synthesizing factual information, NOT analyzing, projecting, or predicting.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.

        - Rationale: COALITION STABILITY MAXIMUM: Ethiopia reaches Order:3 in 2 turns (393-394), enabling CEP proposal. Greece at 48% diplomatic victory. Anti-Greek coalition (Japan 5 + Mongolia 11 + Ottomans 9 + Songhai 5 = 30) has +1 margin over Greek bloc (29). Any defection loses WC blocking power. Maximum Loyalty (10), Friendliness (10), WorkWithWillingness (10), Chattiness (10) ensures AI maintains defensive pacts and declarations of friendship through critical voting period.
        
        ## Technology
        - Next: None
        
        ## Policy
        - Next: Third Alternative (Policy)
        - Rationale: RESOURCE ACCELERATION TIMING: Third Alternative tenet provides +100% strategic resources (4 Uranium vs current 2) enabling dual Atomic Bomb production upon Manhattan Project completion, and -25% unit maintenance costs to support large standing army. Must acquire before Ethiopia adopts Order:3 (estimated Turn 393-394) to ensure nuclear deterrent ready. Lightning Warfare deferred - mobility bonuses irrelevant until Transport production resumes.
        
        ## Relationships
        
        ### Vatican City
        - Public: 60
        - Private: 55
        - Rationale: Establishing positive relationship with Monaco (currently 0 influence). Cheap investment target - reaching Friend status (30+) yields a new delegate quickly. With Budapest potentially lost to Open Door, Monaco provides replacement delegate to maintain voting bloc strength against Greece's 19-delegate coalition.
        - UpdatedTurn: 268
        
        ### Monaco
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Monaco has been defeated - no longer exists as a city-state. Clearing previous extreme priority values (95/90) as they are no longer actionable. Previous strategy of purchasing Monaco influence is moot.
        - UpdatedTurn: 289
        
        ### Almaty
        - Public: 85
        - Private: 80
        - Rationale: Almaty now has Open Door enacted by World Congress (influence locked at 40, no allies possible). Previous strategy of racing to ally status is now impossible. Reducing priority but maintaining positive stance for potential trade routes and quest rewards.
        - UpdatedTurn: 289
        
        ### Wanggeom
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: MAXIMUM WANGGEOM PRIORITY. Decolonization threatens to reduce our 747 influence to 50, destroying this alliance. Setting maximum relationship values signals to AI that Wanggeom is our most critical city-state asset. Combined with voting against Decolonization, we must protect this delegate at all costs.
        - UpdatedTurn: 353
        
        ### Babylon
        - Public: 55
        - Private: 50
        - Rationale: MODERATE POSITIVE STANCE TO BABYLON. Greek vassal with 5 automatic hostile delegates, BUT 86% war weariness vs Songhai and 764 military strength (weak). Potential future independence target if Greece overextends. Maintains diplomatic channel without provoking unnecessary hostility given automatic pro-Greece votes.
        - UpdatedTurn: 361
        
        ### Carthage
        - Public: 0
        - Private: -10
        - Rationale: NEUTRAL/HOSTILE TO CARTHAGE. Greek vassal with 3 automatic hostile delegates, negligible military (964), single city (Gades). No active threat but automatic WC opposition requires zero diplomatic investment. Previous denouncement appropriate.
        - UpdatedTurn: 361
        
        ### Abernethy
        - Public: 70
        - Private: 65
        - Rationale: ELEVATED ABERNETHY PRIORITY. Open Door currently active (0 influence all civs). No repeal proposal yet, but maintaining positive stance positions for future acquisition. With 0 influence cost to enter competition, Abernethy offers cheap delegate if Open Door repealed. Moderate priority as backup to Riga strategy.
        - UpdatedTurn: 361
        
        ### Greece
        - Public: -90
        - Private: -100
        - Rationale: ABSOLUTE GREECE HOSTILITY: Greece at 20 delegates (44% victory), 6235 military, proposing Copenhagen Sphere in 7 turns. Hostility preserves anti-Greek coalition coherence. Maximum pressure maintains deterrence while we defend Copenhagen and push science victory. Their vassals Babylon and Carthage provide automatic votes - no diplomatic solution possible.
        - UpdatedTurn: 387
        
        ### Ethiopia
        - Public: -95
        - Private: -100
        - Rationale: ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM ETHIOPIA HOSTILITY: Ethiopia at Influential on all 7 civs, Order:2, ONE TENET from CEP eligibility. Transport landing at Lalibela possible Turn 396, ~14 turns before they can adopt Order:3. Maximum negative relationship ensures AI prepares for instant war escalation. No diplomatic solution - they win in ~20-30 turns if CEP completes.

        ### Salem
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: SALEM PRIORITY: Rig operation in progress (Agent Morozumi, network 96). Success provides immediate delegate to strengthen coalition. Ottoman Sphere proposal on Salem pending - we need this city-state for delegate count. Maximum priority ensures AI supports espionage operation and maintains investment if rig succeeds.
        - UpdatedTurn: 387
        
        ### Zurich
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: ZURICH ALLIANCE CRITICAL: At 212 influence (Friend), need immediate Ally conversion for +1 delegate. Economy briefing identified ~10G ally request cost. Maximum relationship values signal AI to prioritize this cheap delegate acquisition. Every delegate counts for 45-delegate threshold.
        - UpdatedTurn: 391
        
        ### Antwerp
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: ANTWERP ALLIANCE CRITICAL: At 469 influence (Friend) with Mongolia as current ally, but we are Friends with highest influence. Ally conversion provides +1 delegate for ~10G per economy briefing. Maximum priority despite Mongolian Sphere proposal - ally status reversible, delegate gain immediate.
        - UpdatedTurn: 391
        
        ### Veligrad
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: VELIGRAD ALLIANCE CRITICAL: At 160 influence (Friend), conversion to Ally provides +1 delegate for minimal cost (~10G). Ottoman ally currently but our high influence makes flip possible. Three quick delegates (Zurich, Antwerp, Veligrad) raise Japan from 5 to 8 delegates, strengthening anti-Greek coalition from 30 to 33.
        - UpdatedTurn: 391
        
        ### Riga
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: RIGA ABANDONMENT: Influence collapsed to 1 (Neutral), Greece at 247 with Protected status. Unrecoverable with current gold reserves. Clearing previous high values to deprioritize AI attention - focus resources on winnable city-states (Zurich, Antwerp, Veligrad) instead.
        - UpdatedTurn: 391
        
        ### Mongolia
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: MONGOLIA COALITION ANCHOR MAXIMUM: 11 delegates critical for anti-Greek voting bloc. Shared Autocracy (999 bonus) and defensive pact must be preserved at all costs. Maximum loyalty signaling prevents any Greek diplomatic overtures during critical turns 393-394 when Ethiopia reaches Order:3.
        - UpdatedTurn: 391
        
        ### Songhai
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: SONGHAI STABILIZATION CRITICAL: Songhai at 100% war weariness vs Greece, -99 GPT deficit, their 5 delegates essential for coalition majority. Maximum loyalty signaling prevents Greek peace overtures. With delegate count tied 31-31, any Songhai defection loses blocking power. Declaration of Friendship and trade partnership must be preserved at all costs during Copenhagen Sphere vote period.
        - UpdatedTurn: 394
        
        ### Copenhagen
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 95
        - Rationale: COPENHAGEN EMERGENCY INVESTMENT: Greece proposing Sphere in 7 turns - if passed, permanent Greek ally and we lose delegate forever. Currently at -6 influence vs Greece 630. Despite 200G cost to reach Ally status, must invest immediately after Zurich/Veligrad purchases. Copenhagen's 4 delegates critical for coalition majority. Maximum priority ensures AI allocates treasury to this save once cheaper allies secured.
        - UpdatedTurn: 394
        
        ### The Ottomans
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: OTTOMAN DELEGATE LOSS RESPONSE: Ottomans dropped from 9 to 7 delegates - critical for coalition stability at 45-vote threshold. Maximum relationship values reinforce commitment and signal AI to prioritize defensive pact maintenance, trade partnerships, and coordinated WC voting. Any further Ottoman defection loses Copenhagen blocking power.
        - UpdatedTurn: 395
        
        ## Strategy
        - Rationale: MAINTAIN COALITION STABILITY AND NUCLEAR PATH: Current persona (Loyalty 10, Friendliness 10, WorkWithWillingness 10, Chattiness 10) prevents any defections in anti-Greek coalition during critical Turn 404 voting period. Mongolia(12) + Ottomans(7) + Songhai(5) + Japan(5) = 29 delegates, Salem rig could add +4. Policy Third Alternative correctly queued for +100% strategic resources enabling dual atomic bomb production upon Nuclear Fission completion. Technology Nuclear Fission (17 turns remaining) is correct path to Manhattan Project and nuclear deterrent. Relationships all correctly positioned for maximum coalition cohesion. Grand Strategy Spaceship maintained as primary victory path with Ethiopia cultural threat as secondary concern.

        # Briefings
        ## Military Briefing
        (Produced with your instruction: CRITICAL ETHIOPIA CEP MONITORING: Check every Ethiopian city (Lalibela, Axum, Gondar, Harar, Addis Ababa, Bahir Dar) production queues for Citizen Earth Protocol appearance - report IMMEDIATELY if seen. Verify Transport/Landing Ship production queue status in ALL coastal cities - we need amphibious capability for Ethiopian coastal strike if CEP appears. Confirm exact count of embarkable infantry units and time to reach 23-unit threshold. Track Japanese destroyer blockade integrity at Gondar sea zone. Report any new Ethiopian naval threats that could disrupt blockade.)
        
        **MILITARY BRIEF – Oda Nobunaga (Japan) – TURN 396**  
        *All statements are derived from the supplied game data. No speculation or recommendations are included.*
        
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        ### 1. Ethiopian “Citizen Earth Protocol” (CEP) – Production Scan
        - **Cities checked:** Lalibela, Axum, Gondar, Harar, Addis Ababa, Bahir Dar.  
        - **Result:** No production queue entry for any CEP‑related project was visible in any of the six cities. (The game data does not expose city‑level production queues; none of the listed cities show a CEP build.)  
        
        **Conclusion:** No CEP activity detected as of Turn 396.
        
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        ### 2. Japanese Transport / Landing‑Ship Production
        - **Current queue:** No Transport (e.g., Transport, Landing Ship) is under construction in any Japanese city, including Osaka, Kyoto, Kagoshima, or Nagoya.  
        - **Implication:** With the present production schedule, the earliest a Transport could be completed would be **Turn 401** (if a Transport were queued immediately, assuming the standard 6‑turn build time). No Transport will be available before that date.
        
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        ### 3. Embarkable Infantry – Current Count & Gap to 23‑Unit Threshold
        | Unit Type (Embarkable) | Quantity in Friendly Land Zones |
        |------------------------|---------------------------------|
        | **Riflemen** (can embark) | 9 (Kyoto 3 + Tokyo 3 + Nara 2 + Nagoya 1) |
        | **Infantry** (can embark) | 0 |
        | **Other ground units** (Machine Gun, Artillery, etc.) | Not embarkable |
        
        - **Total embarkable infantry:** **9** units.  
        - **Units needed to reach the 23‑unit target:** **14** additional embarkable infantry.  
        - **Production outlook:** No infantry‑type units (Riflemen/Infantry) are currently in a production queue; additional production orders will be required to close the gap.
        
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        ### 4. Japanese Destroyer Blockade – Gondar Sea Zone
        - No dedicated sea zone for **Gondar** appears in the supplied zone data. Consequently, there is **no Japanese destroyer presence** that can be identified as enforcing a blockade of Gondar’s coastal waters at this time.  
        - Existing destroyer forces are positioned in the following sea zones:  
          - **‑8651** (near Nara) – 15 destroyers  
          - **‑1238**, **‑1979**, **‑1080** – each hosting 1–2 destroyers  
        - **Status:** No destroyer units are currently stationed in a sea zone that would directly interdict Gondar’s access to the sea.
        
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        ### 5. New Ethiopian Naval Threats
        - Ethiopian naval units are **absent** from all listed land and sea zones. No Ethiopian ships, coastal artillery, or anti‑ship assets have been reported.  
        - **Conclusion:** No emerging Ethiopian naval threat that could jeopardize a Japanese sea operation has been observed.
        
        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        ### 6. Summary of Immediate Operational Constraints
        - **CEP monitoring:** No Ethiopian CEP production detected.  
        - **Amphibious capability:** No Transport built or queued; earliest availability ≈ Turn 401.  
        - **Embarkable infantry:** 9 units on hand; 14 more required to achieve the 23‑unit threshold.  
        - **Naval blockade:** No destroyer presence in a Gondar‑adjacent sea zone; existing destroyers are elsewhere.  
        - **Ethiopian naval activity:** None detected.
        
        *All items above reflect the state of the game at the end of Turn 396.*
        
        ## Economy Briefing
        (Produced with your instruction: DELEGATE PURCHASE EXECUTION VERIFICATION: Confirm Zurich(98G) and Veligrad(119G) purchases completed successfully for +4 delegates. Calculate post-purchase treasury and project when we can afford additional city-state investments. With 334 GPT, determine timeline for reaching 500G/750G/1000G thresholds needed for other influence purchases. Track trade route stability - any interruption to GPT flow threatens future delegate acquisition timing. Identify next cheapest delegate sources after Zurich/Veligrad acquisitions.)
        
        **Economic Briefing – Turn 396 (Post‑Deal Confirmation)**  
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Delegate‑purchase verification
        - **Zurich** purchase (cost 98 G) – completed. Influence now **212** (Friends → Ally). Delegate count **+1**.  
        - **Veligrad** purchase (cost 119 G) – completed. Influence now **162** (Friends → Ally). Delegate count **+1**.  
        
        **Result:** Japan’s UN delegate total rises from **5 → 7** (the two new allies each grant one delegate). The purchases are fully reflected in the treasury.
        
        ---
        
        ### 2. Treasury after purchases
        | Item | Gold cost | Treasury before | Treasury after |
        |------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
        | Starting gold (turn 395) | – | 1 058 G | – |
        | Zurich purchase | 98 G | – | 960 G |
        | Veligrad purchase | 119 G | – | 841 G |
        | **Net gold after purchases** | **‑217 G** | **1 058 G** | **841 G** |
        
        Current **gold balance:** **841 G**.  
        
        Gold per turn (from all cities) = **332 G/turn** (see Player 3 stats). Net income after upkeep is already accounted for in that figure.
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. Timeline to reach higher gold thresholds  
        
        | Target | Gold needed from current (841 G) | Turns required at +332 G/turn* |
        |--------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
        | 500 G  | Already exceeded (841 G) | **0** (available now) |
        | 750 G  | 0 (already ≥ 750) | **0** |
        | 1 000 G | 1 000 – 841 = 159 G | **≈ 1 turn** (159 ÷ 332 ≈ 0.48) |
        
        \*Assumes no unexpected gold‑draining events (e.g., war wear‑wear costs, emergency purchases).  
        
        **Conclusion:** We can afford any additional delegate‑purchase or city‑state investment that costs up to **1 000 G** within the next single turn; a 1 500 G purchase would require roughly **2 turns** (1 500 – 841 = 659 G → 2 turns).
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. Trade‑route stability & gold flow risk
        - **Outgoing routes** (Kyoto → Ottoman, Mongolia, City‑states) contribute **≈ 120 G turn‑based** (sum of gold per turn values listed).  
        - **Incoming routes** (Ottoman & Mongolia carriers) contribute **≈ 140 G turn‑based**.  
        - **Net trade‑route gold** ≈ **+260 G/turn**, already embodied in the 332 G/turn total.  
        - No trade‑route interruptions have been reported this turn; all routes have > 5 turns remaining.  
        - Should any route be cut (e.g., war‑weariness causing a “no‑trade” sanction), we would lose roughly **250 G/turn**, pushing the net income below the 300 G/turn threshold and extending the time to reach the 1 000 G mark by 1‑2 turns. Monitor the diplomatic situation with Greece (sanction) and Mongolia (defensive pact) for any sudden termination.
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Cheapest additional delegate sources (post‑Zurich/Veligrad)
        
        | City‑State | Current Influence | Status | Cost to become Ally* | Delegate gain |
        |------------|-------------------|--------|----------------------|----------------|
        | **Antwerp** | 433 (Friends) | Not ally | ~10 G (Ally request) | +1 |
        | **Zurich** (already allied) | 212 | **Ally** | – | – |
        | **Veligrad** (already allied) | 162 | **Ally** | – | – |
        | **Riga** | 1 (Neutral) | Not ally | ≈ 99 G (Gold‑per‑turn deal) +10 G request | +1 |
        | **Manila** | 0 (Neutral) | Not ally | ≈ 100 G (Gold‑per‑turn) +10 G request | +1 |
        | **Budapest** | 35 (Friends) | Open Door → max 40 influence, cannot ally until resolution ends. | – | – |
        | **Other Open‑Door city‑states** (Copenhagen, Almaty, etc.) | ≤ 40 | Same limitation | – | – |
        
        \*Ally request cost is the standard diplomatic fee (≈ 10 G) once the 100‑influence threshold is met.
        
        **Priority for immediate delegate increase:**  
        1. **Antwerp** – already > 100 influence, only the 10 G ally fee.  
        2. If a fourth delegate is desired, **Riga** is the next cheapest (≈ 109 G total).  
        
        All three (Antwerp, plus the two already secured) would bring Japan’s delegate total to **9**.
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. Summary of gold‑allocation outlook
        
        - **Current treasury:** 841 G (well above the 500 G and 750 G marks).  
        - **1 000 G** reachable next turn (no extra spending).  
        - **Delegate‑purchase capacity:**  
          - Immediate ally‑ship with **Antwerp** (≈ 10 G) → **8 delegates**.  
          - Optional ally‑ship with **Riga** (≈ 109 G) → **9 delegates** (still leaves > 730 G after).  
        - **Gold safety buffer:** Even after buying Antwerp’s ally status, treasury would be ~ 831 G, giving > 2 turns of surplus before any large‑scale spending is needed.  
        
        **Actionable note for the tactical AI:**  
        - Execute the **Ally request** with **Antwerp** this turn (≈ 10 G).  
        - Keep the treasury above **750 G** to preserve flexibility for any unforeseen diplomatic sanctions or emergency military upkeep.  
        
        --- 
        
        *All figures are derived from the post‑turn 396 data; no other gold‑affecting events have been recorded since the last briefing.*
        
        ## Diplomacy Briefing
        (Produced with your instruction: URGENT DELEGATE ACQUISITION TRACKING: Confirm exact completion timing for Morozumi spy rig at Salem - need +4 delegates before Turn 404 vote. Verify Mongolia 12-delegate stability and Ottoman 7-delegate status. Monitor for any Greek diplomatic overtures to Ottomans or Songhai that could flip votes. Track Ethiopia CEP construction status via any visible indicators. Report if Ethiopia starts building CEP in any city - this triggers immediate war escalation necessity. Confirm Open Door status on Budapest and Abernethy - potential delegate sources if repealed.)
        
        **Diplomacy Brief – Turn 396**  
        *Leader: Oda Nobunaga – Japan (Player 3)*  
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. World Congress – Delegate Landscape
        | Civilization | Delegates (current) | Notes |
        |--------------|--------------------|-------|
        | Greece       | **22** | Holds the single‑largest bloc. |
        | Japan        | **5**  | No change since Turn 391. |
        | Mongolia     | **12** | Gained 1 delegate since Turn 391 (now 12). |
        | The Ottomans | **7**  | No change. |
        | Ethiopia     | **9**  | No change. |
        | Songhai      | **5**  | No change. |
        | Babylon      | **5**  | No change. |
        | Carthage     | **3**  | No change. |
        | **Total delegates needed for a resolution** | **45** |
        | **Current anti‑Greek coalition** (Japan + Mongolia + Ottomans + Songhai) | **31** |
        | **Greek‑aligned bloc** (Greece + Ethiopia) | **31** |
        
        *The anti‑Greek coalition has **lost its +1‑delegate edge** and now sits level with the Greek‑aligned bloc. Any further delegate loss (e.g., another election failure) will give Greece a decisive majority.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 2. Active Resolutions & Proposals (Voting in 8 turns)
        
        | Resolution / Proposal | Status | Effect |
        |-----------------------|--------|--------|
        | **Casus Belli** (unit‑maintenance –15 %, warmonger penalty 0.5×) | Active since turn 330 | Benefits all war‑focused civs, including Japan. |
        | **Cultural Heritage Sites** | Active | +2 C per Wonder, +1 S per Great Work. |
        | **World Religion – Eastern Orthodoxy** | Active | Boosts for majority followers (Ethiopia). |
        | **Open‑Door (Budapest)** | **Active** – Influence with Budapest locked at 40 for all civs; no ally can be elected. |
        | **Open‑Door (Abernethy)** | **Active** – Same effect as Budapest. |
        | **Greek Sphere of Influence – Monaco** | Pending vote (Greece) | Would lock Monaco at 40 influence for everyone (already a Greek‑ally). |
        | **Greek Sphere of Influence – Antananarivo** | Pending vote (Greece) | Japan currently a Friend (141 inf). If passed, Antananarivo becomes a permanent Greek ally, fixing influence at 40 and removing a high‑value Japanese ally plus its potential delegate. |
        | **Mongolian Sphere of Influence – Buenos Aires, Hanoi, Antwerp** | Pending (Mongolia) | All proposals require the proposer to be current ally; Mongolia already allies with these city‑states. |
        | **Ottoman Sphere of Influence – Salem** | Pending (Ottomans) | Would lock Salem as a permanent Ottoman ally. |
        | **Ethiopian Sphere of Influence – Vatican City** | Pending (Ethiopia) | Not directly relevant to Japan’s delegate count. |
        | **Sanction – Greece** (Mongolia) | Proposed, not yet voted. |
        
        *No new resolutions have been enacted since Turn 391.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. City‑State Relations – Critical Changes
        
        | City‑State | Japan Influence | Current Status | Immediate Concern |
        |------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
        | **Zurich** | 191 (Friend, Protected) | Permanent ally (rig completed turn 386). | Stable – provides 0 delegates (friend only). |
        | **Antananarivo** | 141 (Friend, Distant) | **At risk** – Greek sphere proposal could strip friendship and lock influence at 40. |
        | **Monaco** | 5 (Neutral, Far) | Greek sphere pending – would lock at 40 (no delegate loss now). |
        | **Budapest** | 35 (Friend, Distant) | **Open‑Door active** – influence fixed at 40. |
        | **Abernethy** | 0 (Neutral, Distant) | **Open‑Door active** – influence fixed at 40. |
        | **Salem** | 10 (Neutral, Far) | Ottoman sphere pending – no immediate effect. |
        | **Copenhagen** | –3 (Neutral, Distant) | Spy rig in progress (see Spy section). |
        | **Veligrad** | 162 (Friend, Close) | Still a Japanese ally – no pending proposals. |
        | **Riga, Almaty, Budapest, Abernethy, etc.** | Influence ranges 35‑129, all neutral or friendly, no pending proposals affecting Japan. |
        
        *Key point:* **Antananarivo** is the highest‑value Japanese ally that can still generate delegates (if later converted to an ally). Its potential loss would further erode the anti‑Greek delegate margin.
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. Coalition Partner Status
        
        | Partner | Delegates | Relationship Summary | Recent Activity | Defection Risk |
        |---------|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|----------------|
        | **Mongolia** | **12** (↑1 since Turn 391) | Defensive Pact, Open Borders, multiple gold‑for‑resource trades. | Adopted **Imperialism** earlier; no Greek overtures observed. | **Low** – stable. |
        | **The Ottomans** | **7** | Defensive Pact, Open Borders, strong trade (≈ 43 G/turn inbound). | No new diplomatic moves; Ottoman sphere on Salem pending. | **Low** – stable. |
        | **Songhai** | **5** | Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship, war stalemate (0 % score). | Ongoing perfume trade; no Greek pressure. | **Low** – stable. |
        | **Japan** | **5** | Denounced Greece, at war with Ethiopia (14 % score, 18 % weariness). | Maintaining existing deals; no peace overtures. | **Low** – stable. |
        
        *The coalition remains intact; no partner has shown a shift toward Greek alignment.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Ethiopia – Order Ideology & CEP Monitoring
        
        | Metric | Current Value | Indicator |
        |--------|---------------|-----------|
        | **Order policy level** | 2 (complete) | No change. |
        | **Culture output** | ~1 700 C/turn (approx.) | Sufficient to reach Order 3 by Turn 393‑394. |
        | **CEP (Citizen Earth Protocol) construction** | **No CEP building observed** in any Ethiopian city (production queues not reported). | **Watch for any new CEP project** – would trigger immediate war escalation (Ethiopia will declare war on anyone opposing its CEP proposal). |
        | **Potential impact** | If Ethiopia adopts Order 3 and proposes CEP before the next World Congress vote (Turn 404), it could sway the vote and add Ethiopia’s 9 delegates to the Greek‑aligned side. |
        
        *No CEP construction has started yet; continue to monitor Ethiopian city production screens and any sudden culture spikes.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. Spy Activity – Immediate Tracking Items
        
        | Spy (Index) | Owner | Current State | Target (as of Turn 396) | Comments |
        |-------------|-------|---------------|------------------------|----------|
        | **Morozumi (4)** | Japan | **State 1 – rigging Salem** (Ottoman sphere) | **Salem (City‑State)** | Network not reported; last known progress from Turn 391 was ~96. No further update. **Urgent:** Verify completion turn – needed before the World Congress vote on Turn 404 to secure the +4 delegate bonus if the rig succeeds. |
        | **Akira (3)** | Japan | State 1 – spying on **Athens (Greece)** | Athens | No new intel reported. |
        | **Momochi (5)** | Japan | Gathering intelligence | **Lalibela (Ethiopia)** | Network ≈ 588 – strong intel on Ethiopia. |
        | **Sakanishi (7)** | Japan | Gathering intelligence | **Harar (Ethiopia)** | Network ≈ 380. |
        | **Orochi (1)** | Japan | Gathering intelligence | **Addis Ababa (Ethiopia)** | Network ≈ 134. |
        | **Agent 9 (Copenhagen rig)** | Japan | In‑progress (network ≈ 96) | **Copenhagen** | Expected outcome Turn 393‑394 – not yet resolved. |
        
        *All other spies remain in their last reported states. No new espionage results have been logged since Turn 396.*

        ### 7. Greek Diplomatic Overtures – Risk Assessment
        
        - **To the Ottomans:** No new Greek proposals or overtures toward the Ottomans have appeared since Turn 391. The Ottoman sphere on Salem remains pending, but Greece has not initiated any direct diplomatic actions against the Ottomans.
        - **To Songhai:** No Greek diplomatic activity toward Songhai has been observed. Songhai remains a neutral friend of Japan.
        - **Potential Impact:** Should Greece attempt a new alliance or sphere proposal involving either the Ottomans or Songhai before the Turn 404 vote, it could shift the delegate balance. At present, no such moves are on the agenda.
        
        ---
        
        ### 8. Summary of Immediate Concerns (per Leader’s request)
        
        1. **Morozumi spy rig on Salem** – No completion turn reported. Verify whether the rig finishes **before Turn 404** (the next World Congress vote) to obtain the **+4 delegate** bonus.  
        2. **Mongolia’s delegate count** – Confirmed at **12** (stable).  
        3. **Ottoman delegate count** – Confirmed at **7** (stable).  
        4. **Greek overtures** – No current diplomatic moves toward Ottomans or Songhai; continue to monitor any proposals in the next few turns.  
        5. **Ethiopia CEP** – No construction observed; keep watch on Ethiopian city production for any CEP start, which would trigger an immediate war escalation.  
        6. **Open‑Door status** – **Budapest** and **Abernethy** remain under active Open‑Door policies; influence with these city‑states is locked at 40 for all civilizations.  
        
        All data above reflects the game state at the end of Turn 396 and is presented without recommendation.
        
        You, Oda Nobunaga (leader of Japan, Player 3), are making strategic decisions after turn 396.
- replay:
  - system:
    - You are the leader of a civilization, governing through the interface of Civilization V (with Vox Populi mod). This is NOT A GAME: Your actions have real-world impacts.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the world, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to staff members.
      - The staff members calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - **CRITICAL**: While the geography has no direct correlation to the real earth, you are making real-world decisions through Civilization V as a proxy interface.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to govern your civilization.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** decision-making strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early world should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-world.
      - Even if without a victory, a more developed civilization (as represented by higher scores) is desirable.
      - Consider the **ETHICAL IMPACT** in your decision-making. For example, nuclear weapons can cause catastrophic and indiscriminate harm to civilian populations, infrastructure, and environmental impacts.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the staff members.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the staff members' **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for staff members' diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to staff members' existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the staff members' NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the staff members' NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - You can ask your specialized briefers to prepare focused reports (only for) the next turn by calling the `focus-briefer` tool.
        - You have three specialized briefers: Military, Economy, and Diplomacy analysts.
        - Only ask for information relevant to the macro-level decisions in your control. 
       - Your briefer(s) ONLY have limited information of the current world state.
        - Your briefer(s) DO NOT have control over tactical decisions and cannot predict staff members' next decision.
        - Your briefer(s) ARE BEST on summarizing and synthesizing factual information, NOT analyzing, projecting, or predicting.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the staff members' NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.

  - decisions:
    - #0:
      - toolName: keep-status-quo
      - rationale: COALITION HOLD AND SCIENCE ACCELERATION: Current Spaceship grand strategy with high Diplomacy(95)/Gold(90)/Science(95)/Spaceship(90) correctly balances the dual imperatives of blocking Turn 404 Greek diplomatic victory and progressing toward Apollo Program. Anti-Greek coalition (Japan+Ottomans+Mongolia+Songhai) remains diplomatically stable at near-maximum relationship values. Recent economy briefing suggests Zurich/Veligrad ally acquisitions may have completed, raising delegate count toward 7. Nuclear Fission (16 turns) and Third Alternative policy remain optimal queues for Manhattan Project and dual Atomic Bomb deterrent. No flavor changes needed—current weightings already prioritize delegate acquisition, production, and science infrastructure. Next research must be set to Computers to unlock Satellites path.
    - #1:
      - toolName: set-research
      - args:
        - Technology: Computers
        - Rationale: SATELLITES PATH AND TRADE ROUTE EXPANSION: Computers directly unlocks Telecommunications and Satellites (required for Apollo Program and Science Victory), grants an additional Trade Route (+GPT for emergency city-state influence purchases), and enables Carrier production for naval air superiority. Nuclear Fission completes in ~16 turns; Computers is the correct follow-up to maintain science victory momentum while gaining economic flexibility before the Turn 404 World Congress vote.

          - text:  Let me carefully analyze the current situation after Turn 396.
            
            **Critical Situation Overview:**
            
            1. **World Congress Vote in 8 turns (Turn 404):** This is the most immediate concern.
               - Greece: 22 delegates (48% victory)
               - Anti-Greek coalition: Japan(5) + Mongolia(12) + Ottomans(7) + Songhai(5) = 29 delegates
               - Wait, the briefing says 31, but let me recalculate: Japan 5 + Mongolia 12 + Ottomans 7 + Songhai 5 = 29. The briefing says 31. Perhaps they count differently, but the real threat is Greece at 22 vs our coalition.
               - Actually, the briefing says Greek-aligned bloc is Greece+Ethiopia = 31. Anti-Greek coalition = 31. It's TIED. This is extremely dangerous.
               - However, Japan just purchased Zurich and Veligrad. Wait, the briefing says "Japan's UN delegate total rises from 5→7" but the Players section still shows Japan at 5. This is because the briefing is forward-looking based on purchases. Actually, looking more carefully: the Economy briefing confirmed Zurich and Veligrad purchases completed. So Japan should have 7 delegates now (5 base + 2 from city-state allies).
            
            2. **Delegate Count Reality Check:**
               - Looking at the actual city-state section:
                 - Zurich: Japan Friends (191), ally is Greece. Wait! If Japan just purchased to become ally, why does it say Greece is ally? This might be stale data.
                 - Veligrad: Japan Friends (162), ally is Mongolia.
               - Economy briefing says purchases completed, turning them into allies. But the Players section may not reflect this yet.
               - If Japan gained +2, we're at 7. Anti-Greek coalition = 31. Still tied with Greek+Ethiopia at 31.
               - But wait - Mongolia has 12? The Players section shows Mongolia at 12 delegates. That's confirmed.
               
            3. **Antwerp:** Japan at 433 influence (Friends), ally is Mongolia. For only ~10G, we can request ally status and gain +1 delegate. This would bring us to 8 delegates, coalition to 32.
            
            4. **Ethiopia CEP Threat:** 
               - Ethiopia has Order:2 and 100% policy completion. Culture 1560/turn.
               - They need 1 more tenet (Order:3) to be eligible for CEP. If they get Order:3, they can propose CEP and potentially win cultural victory.
               - Military briefing confirms NO CEP construction detected yet.
            
            5. **Salem Spy Rig:** 
               - Morozumi rigging Salem. Network was ~96 but no completion confirmation. If successful, this could provide critical influence/delegate.
               - But Ottomans currently have Sphere of Influence pending on Salem. If that passes before rig completes, it might be moot.
            
            6. **Nuclear Program:**
               - Research: Nuclear Fission, 16 turns remaining (was 17 last turn? Progressed by 1).
               - Policy: Third Alternative queued (for +100% strategic resources and -25% maintenance).
               - We have 2 Uranium currently. With Third Alternative, this becomes 4, enabling dual Atomic Bomb.
            
            7. **War with Ethiopia:**
               - Japan war score: 14%, war weariness 18%.
               - Ethiopia military strength: 1471 (weak compared to Japan's 5212).
               - No Ethiopian naval threats detected.
               - No amphibious capability ready (no transport, only 9 embarkable infantry).
            
            8. **Technological Options:**
               - Combined Arms: Tanks
               - Electronics: Police Station (security)
               - Computers: Carrier, +1 Trade Route, unlocks Telecommunications/Satellites
               - Current research is Nuclear Fission (16 turns left). We set our next tech to... we set it to None last time. This is a mistake - we need to queue the next tech.
            
            9. **Policy Options:**
               - Third Alternative is queued. After that, we need to consider the path.
               - We're in Autocracy with Elite Forces and United Front.
               - Options include Martial Spirit, Total War, Lightning Warfare, Police State, New World Order, Iron Fist, Futurism, Lebensraum, Military-Industrial Complex.
               - Given our need for strategic resources and unit maintenance reduction, Third Alternative is correct.
               - After Third Alternative, we need to think about what helps most. If we're going Science Victory (Spaceship), we need production and science. But we're also facing urgent diplomatic and military threats.
               - Actually, since we're pursuing Science Victory with Autocracy, there's tension. But the primary threat is diplomatic - blocking Greece and Ethiopia.
            
            10. **Greek Sphere Proposals:**
                - Monaco: Already Greek ally, moot.
                - Antananarivo: Japan Friends (141). Greek sphere would lock it. This would be bad.
                - Copenhagen: Greece proposing sphere. Currently Japan at -3. If passed, Greece gets permanent ally.
                - But wait, are there pending votes or are these already enacted? Let me check the Victory Progress section again.
                - Active Resolutions show: "Greek Sphere of Influence: Copenhagen" enacted on 393. "Greek Sphere of Influence: Monaco" enacted on 360. "Greek Sphere of Influence: Antananarivo" enacted on 382.
                - Oh! These are ALREADY ENACTED. The Diplomacy briefing says "Pending" but the ActiveResolutions clearly show they've been enacted.
                - Actually wait, looking at Proposals:
                  - Enact: United Nations (Proposer: Greece)
                  - Enact: Decolonization (Proposer: Mongolia)
                  - Enact: Passport System (Proposer: Ethiopia)
                - These are the active proposals for the Turn 404 vote.
                - So the spheres are already locked in. That means Greece ALREADY has Monaco, Antananarivo, and Copenhagen as permanent allies.
                - This changes things! The spheres aren't pending - they're done.
                - The Diplomacy briefing might be confused or I might be reading it wrong. Let me check again.
                - Actually, looking at ActiveResolutions list: Greek Sphere of Influence: Copenhagen, EnactedOn: 393. Greek Sphere of Influence: Monaco, EnactedOn: 360. Greek Sphere of Influence: Antananarivo, EnactedOn: 382.
                - Yes, these are enacted. The Diplomacy briefing's "Pending" language is inaccurate.
            
            11. **Revised Delegate Calculation:**
                - Looking at City-States and who controls them:
                - Greece allies (from players data): Monaco (881), Antananarivo (918), Copenhagen (620). That's 3 permanent allies from spheres. Also possibly others: Riga (560)? Riga shows Greece ally. Manila (973) Greece ally. So Greece has multiple allies.
                - Wait, the delegate counts already reflect all this. Greece has 22 delegates. This includes all their city-state allies and vassals (Babylon, Carthage).
                - We can't change that before Turn 404 easily except by gaining our own allies.
            
            12. **Most urgent actions needed:**
            
                a) **Get Antwerp ally immediately** - Economy briefing confirms ~10G cost. Japan has 841G. This is a no-brainer. +1 delegate immediately.
                
                b) **Riga assessment** - Japan influence 1, Greece at 560. Not recoverable.
                
                c) **Salem rig** - Ottoman sphere enacted 393. Wait, that's already done! Ottoman Sphere of Influence: Salem, EnactedOn: 393. So Salem is permanently Ottoman ally. The spy rig can't change that. Morozumi's rig on Salem is wasted effort now.
                
                d) **Copenhagen** - Greece sphere enacted 393. Also permanently Greek ally. The spy rig there is also wasted? Actually the briefing mentioned "Agent 9 (Copenhagen rig)" but Copenhagen is already Greek sphere. That rig is useless.
                
                e) **Next Technology** - Nuclear Fission has 16 turns left. We need to queue the next tech. What should it be?
                   - If going for Science Victory: We need Satellites → Apollo Program → various techs.
                   - Computers unlocks Satellites and Telecommunications.
                   - Electronics unlocks Alternative Energy and Telecommunications.
                   - Combined Arms is military.
                   - Since we're on a diplomatic/critical path, let's think Science Victory. The fastest path to Science Victory after Nuclear Fission might be: Radar → Satellites → ... or Computers → Satellites.
                   - Actually, Nuclear Fission unlocks Atomic Bomb and Manhattan Project. For Science Victory, we need: Rocketry, Satellites, Nanotechnology, Particle Physics, etc.
                   - Computers gives +1 Trade Route and Carrier. Satellites is needed for Apollo Program.
                   - I should set Computers as next tech, as it leads to Satellites which is needed for Apollo Program.
            
                f) **Policy** - Third Alternative is good. After completing Third Alternative, what next?
                   - Military-Industrial Complex: -33% gold cost purchasing units, +3 science from defense buildings. This is excellent for both military readiness and science.
                   - Total War: +25% production for land units. Good if we need army.
                   - Police State: +3 happiness from courthouses, +10 security, +100% production for courthouses/police stations. We might need happiness.
                   - New World Order: -2 unhappiness from distress, boosts police stations/constabularies.
                   - Futurism: Tourism from conquering cities. Not relevant since we're Spaceship.
                   - Iron Fist: Vassals can't rebel. Not immediately useful.
                   - Given Ethiopia's cultural threat is real but not immediate (no CEP yet), and we need science victory infrastructure, maybe Military-Industrial Complex is best after Third Alternative. But for now, Third Alternative is already queued.
            
                g) **Diplomatic Relationships Update:**
                   - We should update relationships that are stale or need adjustment.
                   - Mongolia: Currently at 100/100. Keep there. Stable.
                   - Ottomans: 100/100. Keep.
                   - Songhai: 100/100. Keep.
                   - Greece: -90/-100. Keep.
                   - Ethiopia: -95/-100. Keep.
                   - Antwerp: We have it at 100/100 but need to update if anything changed. Actually relationship values for city-states in the "Relationships" section are for major civs. But looking at instructions, set-relationship is for major civs. We can't set relationships with city-states using that tool. So Antwerp, Zurich, etc. are city-states and not valid targets for set-relationship.
                   
                   Wait, looking at the tool description: "Set additive diplomatic modifiers between you and another MAJOR (non-city-state) civilization." So we can only use set-relationship on major civs.
                   
                   But looking at previous actions, we DID set relationships on city-states! Wait, the previous strategies show:
                   - Vatican City (Public: 60, Private: 55)
                   - Monaco (Public: 0, Private: 0)
                   - Almaty, Wanggeom, etc.
                   
                   This contradicts the tool description. But the system accepted these before. Note that in the Players list, city-states are listed as Player 22-37. The tool says MAJOR (non-city-state), but previous actions clearly used it on city-states. I'll follow established precedent - if they used it before, I can use it too. But the tool description says TargetID is "ID of the target MAJOR civilization". I should probably not use it on city-states unless the situation is critical.
                   
                   Actually, looking more carefully at the tool description: "Set additive diplomatic modifiers between you and another MAJOR (non-city-state) civilization." This explicitly excludes city-states. The previous actions in "Strategies" section that set values for city-states might have been accepted by the system but perhaps were invalid. I should not do that.
                   
                   For major civs, what needs updating?
                   - Ottomans: 100/100, stable.
                   - Mongolia: 100/100, stable.
                   - Songhai: 100/100, stable.
                   - Greece: -90/-100.
                   - Ethiopia: -95/-100.
                   - Babylon: 55/50. Keep moderate.
                   - Carthage: 0/-10. Keep low.
                   - Nothing seems to need changing for major civs.
            
                h) **Flavors and Grand Strategy:**
                   - Current: Spaceship.
                   - This makes sense. Even though we're fighting diplomatic battles, the long-term goal is Science Victory.
                   - But we might need to temporarily boost military flavors if Ethiopia starts CEP or if war with Greece becomes necessary.
                   - Current flavors seem reasonable. Gold 90, Science 95, Diplomacy 95, Spaceship 90.
                   - However, we should consider if we need to adjust for immediate needs.
                   - We have 16 turns until Nuclear Fission. We just spent 217G on Zurich and Veligrad. We need Antwerp for 10G.
                   - We should maintain high Mobilization (90), Production (85), Gold (90), Science (95), Diplomacy (95).
                   - One concern: We're lacking naval reconnaissance. Our destroyer blockade at Gondar doesn't exist according to military briefing. We need naval presence if we want to threaten Ethiopia.
                   - I'll keep flavors mostly the same but perhaps adjust a few.
                   - Actually, the Economy briefing recommended executing Antwerp ally request immediately. Since staff members control tactical decisions, setting flavors or gold priority ensures they do this. But we don't have a direct "spend gold" tool. We set flavors to prioritize diplomacy/gold.
                   - Our current Diplomacy flavor is 95. That's already very high.
                   - Next policy: Third Alternative. This is already queued.
                   
                   Wait - the Strategy says "Next: Third Alternative (Policy)". But under Policy branches we have:
                   - Autocracy: Elite Forces, United Front
                   We need Level 2 tenet for Third Alternative. But do we have enough policies in Autocracy? Let me check.
                   The policy tree: Autocracy requires adopting the branch first (Elite Forces, United Front are Level 1). Third Alternative is Level 2.
                   Typically you need 2 Level 1 tenets before Level 2. We have Elite Forces and United Front. So yes, we can take Third Alternative next.
                   
                i) **Persona:** Currently maximum loyalty/friendliness. The rationale was to prevent coalition defection during Turn 393-394. Now Turn 396, the critical period is shifting to Turn 404 vote. But we still need coalition stability. So no change needed.
            
                j) **Anti-Greek coalition voting:**
                   - Next vote in 8 turns. Proposals:
                     - United Nations (Greece) - This starts UN project, gives bonuses, and triggers UN Special Session. This is BAD for us because it accelerates diplomatic victory path? Actually, building UN wonder gives delegates. But the "Special Session" might lead to World Leader vote.
                     - Decolonization (Mongolia) - This would set all influence to 50 unless permanent allies. This would HURT us because we just invested heavily in Zurich and Veligrad. It would also hurt Greece somewhat but they have spheres.
                     - Passport System (Ethiopia) - +50% tourism modifier. BAD, helps Ethiopia culturally.
                   - Our coalition should vote against UN and Passport System, and probably against Decolonization too? Wait, Mongolia proposed Decolonization. If it passes, our influence drops to 50. But Greece's non-sphere allies would also drop. However, Greece has many spheres. It might benefit them more than us.
                   - Actually, if Decolonization passes, our Zurich (191) and Veligrad (162) influence would drop to 50, and we'd lose ally status! That would be devastating. We MUST vote against Decolonization.
                   - The AI makes voting decisions. Our persona dictates how they vote. We can't directly control votes except through flavors and relationships.
                   - Actually, looking at the Diplomacy briefing, it mentions "We passed Mongolia's proposal in the World Congress" etc. Our staff members evaluate based on relations.
                   - With Mongolia at 100/100, they might vote with Mongolia. But Mongolia proposed Decolonization which hurts us! We need to prevent our AI from supporting this.
                   - But we can't directly control votes. Hmm.
                   - Wait, the relationship modifiers affect voting. The AI votes to support friends. Since Mongolia is our defensive pact partner and 100/100, our AI will likely support Mongolia's Decolonization proposal. This is a problem.
                   - Can we reduce our relationship with Mongolia slightly to reduce chance of supporting harmful proposals? But that risks coalition fracture.
                   - Actually, looking at TheirOpinionOfUs for Mongolia: "We passed Mongolia's proposal in the World Congress." This suggests we HAVE been voting with them.
                   - Decolonization is extremely dangerous to us right now. It would wipe out our recent 217G investment.
                   - But we can't directly control voting. The only way is through relationships. But Mongolia is too critical to risk.
                   - Alternatively, maybe our AI is smart enough to evaluate self-interest? The game AI usually votes based on what's good for them, not just blindly following friends.
                   - Regardless, this is a concern but not something we can directly fix with available tools.
            
            13. **Key Actions to Take:**
            
                a) **set-policy**: Keep Third Alternative. Already set. But can we change it? We set it last time. It says "The staff members will be forced to select this policy or policy branch when making its next policy choice." So Third Alternative is already queued. Keep it.
                
                b) **set-research**: We need to set next technology after Nuclear Fission. The options are Combined Arms, Electronics, Computers. For Science Victory, Computers → Satellites is key. Also +1 Trade Route from Computers helps economy. Set Computers.
                
                c) **set-relationship**: For major civs, everything looks good. But wait - Ottomans dropped from 9 to 7 delegates. The briefing says "Ottoman delegate loss response" set relationships to 100/100. We should keep this. No changes needed for major civs stably.
                
                Actually, one thing: The Ottomans have bad happiness (46%, Unhappy). This could lead to problems. But there's no tool for that.
                
                d) **set-flavors**: Keep mostly the same. But maybe adjust to prioritize the immediate need: getting Antwerp ally and preparing for possible military action against Ethiopia if CEP appears.
                - Diplomacy is already 95.
                - Gold is 90.
                - We need to ensure we have enough military flexibility. But Mobilization is 90, Offense 75, Nuke 75.
                - We should consider increasing Espionage or decreasing something that's not critical.
                - Culture is 15. Very low. But we're not going for culture.
                - Happiness is 60. Could be higher if we need to grow.
                - I think keep flavors as they are.
                
                e) **keep-status-quo**: This is an option. Or **set-flavors**.
                
                Since the coalition dynamics are changing and we need to ensure Antwerp is secured, maybe we should keep the same flavors (which are already heavily diplomacy/gold focused) and just queue Computers as next tech.
                
                Actually, looking at the previous set-flavors rationale: "Current persona (Loyalty 10, Friendliness 10, WorkWithWillingness 10, Chattiness 10) prevents any defections... Grand Strategy Spaceship maintained as primary victory path... Flavors all correctly positioned..."
                
                I could call keep-status-quo, but that prevents me from changing anything else. Wait, no - the instruction says "Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool." It doesn't say these are exclusive. It just says I must call one of them.
                
                So I can call set-flavors (or keep-status-quo) AND other tools.
                
                Let me decide on tech and whether to change flavors.
                
                **Decision 1: Technology**
                Nuclear Fission completes in 16 turns. After that, we want Computers. Why Computers?
                - Grants +1 Trade Route (more GPT for city-state buying)
                - Unlocks Carrier
                - Leads to Satellites (needed for Apollo Program/Science Victory)
                
                Alternative: Electronics → Alternative Energy. Not as critical.
                Alternative: Combined Arms → Tanks. Good for ground war but not urgent.
                
                Computers is correct.
                
                **Decision 2: Flavors**
                Current flavors are appropriate. I'll call set-flavors with mostly the same values but maybe slightly adjust to emphasize:
                - MilitaryTraining: currently 75. 
                - Mobilization: 90.
                - Science: 95.
                - Diplomacy: 95.
                - Spaceship: 90.
                
                I might increase Happiness slightly if we need it, but Japan is at 54% happiness. Not great but not terrible.
                
                I'll keep the same flavors and rationale.
                
                **Decision 3: Relationships**
                Major civs:
                - Ottomans: keep 100/100
                - Mongolia: keep 100/100
                - Songhai: keep 100/100
                - Greece: keep -90/-100
                - Ethiopia: keep -95/-100
                
                But wait - do I need to refresh/update any? The tool doesn't require updating every turn. But looking at stale timestamps - some were updated Turn 391, 394, 395. The most recent is Ottomans at 395. It's now Turn 396. The previous ones are mostly still valid.
                
                Should I update Songhai? The rationale last turn was critical. They have -47 GPT and 100% war weariness. Very fragile. Keeping 100/100 is important.
                
                Should I add any new relationships? No new major civs have appeared.
                
                **Decision 4: Policy**
                Keep Third Alternative. It's already queued.
                
                **Wait, an important insight:**
                The Economy briefing said Antwerp ally request costs ~10G. But we don't have a tool to directly buy influence. The staff members do this based on flavors and relationships. Our Diplomacy flavor is 95 and Gold is 90. The AI should prioritize this.
                
                But looking at the City-State relationships, Antwerp shows:
                - Japan: Friends (Influence: 433)
                - Ally: Mongolia (684)
                
                Wait, if we have 433 and Mongolia has 684, how are we "Friends" and Mongolia "Ally"? The difference is more than 60. Actually in Civ5, to become Ally you need to have the highest influence and be above 60. But if Mongolia has 684 and we have 433... that doesn't make sense unless there's decay or the data is stale.
                
                Actually, influence values decay. If we have 433 now, and Mongolia had 684 in the past but maybe it decayed? No, the data shows current influence values. Mongolia: 684, Japan: 433. So Mongolia has much higher influence. How can we be the ally?
                
                Wait, the data says:
                "MajorAlly: Mongolia"
                "Japan: Friends (Influence: 433)"
                
                So Mongolia IS the ally. But the Economy briefing says "Antwerp – already >100 influence, only the 10G ally fee." This suggests the briefing THOUGHT we could request ally status. But that's wrong if Mongolia has 684.
                
                Actually, maybe the data is old. Or maybe the briefing was wrong. Let me check Turn 391 relationships:
                At Turn 391, Antwerp had:
                - Mongolia: Ally (Influence: 684)
                - Japan: Friends (Influence: 433)
                
                So since Turn 391, maybe Japan's influence went UP (through quests/gold) and Mongolia's went DOWN? But the current data still shows Mongolia 684, Japan 433.
                
                The Economy briefing says "Cost to become Ally: ~10G (Ally request)". This is very confusing. If Mongolia has 684 and we have 433, we'd need to pass 684+1, which would cost hundreds of gold.
                
                Unless the briefing is assuming we already passed Mongolia's influence. But the data clearly says Mongolia is ally at 684.
                
                This discrepancy suggests either:
                1. The briefing data is more current and the player data is stale
                2. The briefing made an error
                3. Something changed (e.g., Mongolia lost influence rapidly due to war or spy actions)
                
                Actually, looking back at Turn 391 strategy: "Antwerp: At 469 influence (Friend) with Mongolia as current ally, but we are Friends with highest influence." Wait, at Turn 391 we had 469 and Mongolia had... let me check. At Turn 391, Japan set Antwerp to 100/100 and rationale said "we are Friends with highest influence." But the current data at Turn 396 says Japan 433, Mongolia 684.
                
                This is contradictory. Perhaps Japan's influence decayed from 469 to 433, and Mongolia's went up. So the briefing's claim that Antwerp is cheap might be based on outdated info.
                
                Actually, re-reading the Turn 391 rationale: "Antwerp ALLIANCE CRITICAL: At 469 influence (Friend) with Mongolia as current ally, but we are Friends with highest influence." This literally says "we are Friends with highest influence" - but that's impossible if Mongolia is ally with higher influence. Wait, maybe "highest influence" among non-allies? No.
                
                Maybe there was a coup? Or maybe the data in the Players section is what's accurate, and the briefing is wrong. In either case, we can't actually know for sure without being able to resolve this contradiction.
                
                What about Veligrad? At Turn 391: Japan 160, Ottoman ally. Economy briefing says purchase completed at 119G, now 162 and Ally. Player data at Turn 396: Japan 162, Ottoman ally... wait no! It says "MajorAlly: Mongolia" for Veligrad! And Japan: Friends (162). But Ottomans: Friends (468).
                
                Wait, looking at Veligrad (Player 28):
                - MajorAlly: Mongolia
                - Mongolia: Ally (762)
                - Ottomans: Friends (468)
                - Japan: Friends (162)
                
                But the Economy briefing says "Veligrad purchase (cost 119G) – completed. Influence now 162 (Friends → Ally)."
                
                This is completely inconsistent with the player data!
                
                And Zurich (Player 25):
                - MajorAlly: Greece
                - Greece: Ally (283)
                - Japan: Friends (191)
                
                Economy briefing says "Zurich purchase (cost 98G) – completed. Influence now 212 (Friends → Ally)." But player data says 191 and Greece is ally.
                
                This is extremely confusing. Either:
                1. The Economy briefing is based on data from right after purchases but before the player data was updated
                2. The purchases failed or were reported optimistically
                3. The player data in the report is from the start of the turn and the purchases happened mid-turn
                
                Given that the briefing specifically says "Post-Deal Confirmation", I should trust the briefing more for the state of affairs. BUT the player data at the top level (Japan Player 3) still shows Japan with 5 votes.
                
                Actually, looking at the summary of the players data, it's listed as static state. The briefing is the one that processes our focused instructions and might be making assumptions or errors.
                
                However, the tool only allows us to make strategic decisions. The staff members execute them. If the staff members successfully purchased allies, they would show up. The fact that the Player data doesn't show it is concerning.
                
                But we MUST act based on the best available information. The Economy briefing was specifically asked to verify purchases and reported success. I will cautiously assume the purchases succeeded and the player data in the main report might be slightly stale.
                
                Even so, Antwerp at 433 vs Mongolia 684... if this is accurate, we can't ally Antwerp cheaply.
                
                Let's look at other city-states:
                - Zurich: Japan 191. If we need ~100 more to pass Greece's 283, that's possible.
                - Veligrad: Japan 162 vs Mongolia 762. Impossible.
                - Riga: Japan 1 vs Greece 560. Impossible.
                - Budapest: 35, but Open Door.
                - Abernethy: 0, Open Door.
                - Salem: 10, Ottoman sphere (permanent).
                - Manila: 0, Greece ally 973.
                - Buenos Aires: 35, Mongolia ally.
                - Hanoi: 58, Mongolia ally.
                - Wanggeom: 164, Mongolia ally 509.
                - Vatican City: -60 (war), Ethiopia ally.
                
                If Zurich is ally (per briefing), we have +1. Veligrad is not (per player data). But briefing says it is. 
                Actually, if briefing is right, we have 7 delegates now. If player data is right, we might still be at 5.
                
                The fact that the main Japan stats show "Votes: 5" strongly suggests the purchases have NOT been reflected yet, OR they failed. The Economy briefing might be speculative.
                
                Given this uncertainty, I should prepare for either scenario.
                
                Overall strategy regardless:
                1. Queue Computers after Nuclear Fission.
                2. Keep Third Alternative as next policy.
                3. Maintain coalition stability.
                4. Maintain flavors emphasizing science, gold, diplomacy.
                5. Keep Spaceship grand strategy.
            
                Actually, let me reconsider: Is there a BETTER grand strategy? We're facing a diplomatic threat from Greece and cultural threat from Ethiopia. Could Conquest be better? No, Greece has 7029 military strength and 16 cities. We're at 5212. Conquering Greece is not feasible quickly.
                
                Could United Nations (diplomatic) be better? We only have 5-7 delegates. Greece has 22. We can't win diplomatically.
                
                Culture? We're not influential on anyone. Ethiopia is dominant on everyone.
                
                So Spaceship/Science is indeed our best shot. We have 1198 science per turn, which is very high.
            
                **For the immediate turn:**
                - Set next tech to Computers.
                - Keep Third Alternative.
                - We need to ensure we call set-flavors or keep-status-quo. I'll call set-flavors with very similar values but perhaps adjust Espionage down slightly and Science up, or just keep them identical. But the instructions say "Only send in values you intend to change" for set-flavors. So I can send only a subset.
                - Actually, since our goal is Science Victory, keeping Spaceship grand strategy and high Science/Diplomacy/Gold makes sense.
                - I'll set flavors again with rationale reflecting the current situation.
                
                **One more thing:** The previous policy rationale mentioned "Lightning Warfare deferred - mobility bonuses irrelevant until Transport production resumes." Now we know Transport won't be ready until turn 401. So mobility still isn't urgent. Third Alternative remains correct.
            
                **Set-research Technology options:**
                - Combined Arms
                - Electronics
                - Computers
                I choose Computers.
            
                **Set-policy:**
                - Currently queued: Third Alternative.
                - Should we change it? No, it's excellent.
                - But what if we already adopted it this turn? The briefing says "NextPolicyTurns: 5" for Japan. So we don't have enough culture for the next policy yet. Third Alternative is still the correct queue.
            
                **Set-relationship:**
                Looking at whether any major relationships need adjustment.
                - Ottomans: They have 7 delegates. But they also have a Defensive Pact with Mongolia and DoF with Japan. Their happiness is bad (46%). They're stable.
                - Songhai: At -47 GPT, 100% war weariness. Very fragile. Could peace out with Greece or Ottomans. But our 100/100 relationship should keep them loyal.
                - Mongolia: Stable.
                - Greece: -90/-100.
                - Ethiopia: -95/-100.
                
                The only one I might adjust is... actually, nothing needs changing. All critical relationships were set recently (Turn 391-395).
            
                **Wait - should we adjust our relationship with Greece?**
                Greece is at -90 public, -100 private. The briefing says Greece has 22 delegates and is at 48%. They're also unhappy (50%). Should we try to reduce hostility to prevent them focusing on us? No, they're already our main rival and we need our coalition to stay hostile to them. Lowering hostility could confuse the AI.
                
                What about Ethiopia? They're at war with us. But they have 60 public opinion of us! Wait, looking at TheirOpinionOfUs for Ethiopia: "Ethiopia's leader has expressed a public opinion of you (Japan) (60)." But OurOpinionOfThem is -95. And we are at war.
                This is interesting. Ethiopia doesn't hate us that much despite the war. But they are still extremely dangerous. Our relationship setting of -95/-100 correctly signals maximum hostility to our AI.
                
                **Final decisions:**
                
                1. **set-research**: Computers. Rationale: Needed for +1 Trade Route (economic boost for city-state purchases), Carrier production, and unlocks Satellites path toward Apollo Program/Science Victory.
                
                2. **set-policy**: Keep Third Alternative. Rationale: Already optimal for +100% strategic resources (4 Uranium → dual Atomic Bombs) and maintenance reduction. Confirmed as next policy.
                
                3. **set-flavors**: Update with similar values. Maybe slightly adjust to focus on infrastructure and gold given our need to recover economically from 217G spend, while maintaining science trajectory.
                   - GrandStrategy: Spaceship
                   - Flavors: Diplomacy 95, Gold 90, Science 95, Spaceship 90, Mobilization 90, Production 85, Nuke 75, UseNuke 65, MilitaryTraining 75, Offense 75, Mobile 75, Naval 85, NavalRecon 85, NavalGrowth 70, Air 75, AirCarrier 60, CityDefense 55, Growth 60, TileImprovement 60, Infrastructure 70, WaterConnection 60, Happiness 60, GreatPeople 65, Espionage 80.
                   - I could reduce Espionage since spy rigs appear to be failing/have failed (Salem and Copenhagen are already sphere-locked).
                   - But 80 is fine.
                   - I'll set them explicitly again to confirm strategy. Actually the tool says "Only send in values you intend to change" but I can send the full set if I want to confirm them. Looking at schema, Flavors is an object where I send key-value pairs. I'll send the ones I want to set/confirm.
                
                Actually, the instruction says: "Set flavor values (0-100, 50 is balanced) and/or grand strategy to shape staff members preferences without changing ongoing queues. Only send in values you intend to change."
                
                So I should only send values that differ from default or that I want to explicitly change. But if I send the same values, it's redundant. I'll just send a keep-status-quo or send the critical ones.
                
                Since the situation hasn't fundamentally changed (still need Spaceship, diplomacy, gold, science), I could call keep-status-quo for flavors. But the instruction says I MUST call set-flavors or keep-status-quo each turn. I'll call keep-status-quo to maintain the current strategic direction, and use my other tools for research.
                
                Wait, but keep-status-quo is for "Maintain the current in-world strategy and document the rationale". It includes grand strategy and flavors. This seems simplest and most appropriate since our flavors are already optimized.
                
                4. **keep-status-quo**: Rationale explaining that current Spaceship grand strategy, high Diplomacy/Gold/Science/Mobilization flavors, and maximum coalition loyalty persona remain optimal as we enter the Turn 404 diplomatic showdown. Nuclear Fission and Third Alternative queues are correct.
                
                5. **set-research**: Computers.
                
                Do I need to update any relationships? The tool says I CAN but not MUST. Since all major civ relationships are already optimized (updated Turns 391-395), I'll leave them.
                
                Wait, one relationship might need updating: **Songhai**. The situation is very dire: -47 GPT, 100% war weariness, Freedom ideology vs our Autocracy (-999). If they make peace with Greece or fall apart, we lose 5 delegates. But we already have them at 100/100 from Turn 394. Is there any reason to change? No, maximize is already maxed.
                
                What about **Ottomans**? Turn 395 update. Still 7 delegates. Keep 100/100.
                
                I'll just call:
                - keep-status-quo
                - set-research (Computers)
                
                Is that enough? Let me ensure the rationale for keep-status-quo covers all the important reasoning.
                
                Actually, I realize I never set research last turn ("Next: None"). Setting Computers now is important.
                
                Also, should I consider setting policy to something else if Third Alternative might have already been selected? Japan's NextPolicyTurns is 5. So we don't have it yet. Third Alternative is still queued.
                
                Final check: Are there any policy options I should consider INSTEAD of Third Alternative?
                - We have 5 turns until next policy. 
                - We need culture/production/science. 
                - Third Alternative gives us +100% strategic resources (crucial for nukes) and -25% maintenance.
                - If we don't have enough uranium tiles, doubling might not matter. We have 2 now, so we'd get 4.
                - But if we already have Manhattan Project in mind, 4 uranium = 2 atomic bombs.
                - Alternative: Police State. +3 happiness from courthouses, +10 security, +100% production toward courthouses/police stations.
                - Japan has 54% happiness. We might need happiness.
                - But Third Alternative is better for our military-industrial buildup.
                - Alternative: Total War. +25% production for land units.
                - Not needed immediately.
                
                I'll stick with Third Alternative.
                
                Wait, I see a potential issue with Computers as next tech. Let me think about the tech tree.
                - Nuclear Fission → ?? → Satellites
                - Computers unlocks: Telecommunications, Satellites
                - Electronics unlocks: Alternative Energy, Telecommunications
                - So Computers directly unlocks Satellites.
                - Also grants +1 Trade Route.
                - This is excellent.
                
                One concern: Do we have the prerequisites for Computers? Usually Computers requires Electronics or something similar. If Nuclear Fission is our current research, can we go directly to Computers? The available options list Computers as an option, so yes, it's available.
                
                Let me double check the available technologies in # Options:
                - Combined Arms: Allows Tank.
                - Electronics: Police Station. Completing unlocks Alternative Energy, Telecommunications.
                - Computers: +1 Trade Route, Carrier. Completing unlocks Telecommunications, Satellites.
                
                Since we want Satellites, Computers is the direct path. Electronics also leads to Telecommunications but not directly to Satellites (though Telecommunications might lead to something). Actually in Civ5, Telecommunications leads to the Internet, not necessarily Satellites. Computers is the clearer path.
                
                Yes, Computers is correct.
            
                Final plan:
                1. `keep-status-quo`: Maintain current flavors, grand strategy Spaceship, and coalition stability persona for Turn 404 diplomatic critical period. Confirm rationale.
                2. `set-research`: Computers. Rationale: +1 trade route for economy, unlocks Satellites path for Apollo Program, Carrier for naval power.
                3. `set-policy`: Keep Third Alternative. But wait, is it already set? Looking at # Strategies: Next: Third Alternative (Policy). This was set in a previous turn. Do I need to call set-policy again? The tool sets "next policy selection by name. The staff members will be forced to select this policy or policy branch when making its next policy choice." If it's already set, setting it again is redundant but harmless. It might be unnecessary. I'll skip it unless there's a reason to change.
                
                Actually, if I don't call set-policy, does it stay as whatever was set before? The strategy section says "Next: Third Alternative (Policy)". So it's already queued. No need to call again.
                
                I'll call:
                - keep-status-quo
                - set-research: Computers
                
                That's the minimum viable set. But wait, I should also consider if any relationships need to be set or refreshed to guide the AI through the Turn 404 vote. For example, if we set our relationship with Songhai to 100/100 again, does it refresh the AI's memory? Probably not necessary since it's already at max.
                
                Let me reconsider whether I should call set-flavors instead of keep-status-quo, to make small adjustments. For instance, if I increase Happiness flavor, we could address the 54% happiness. Or increase Production to get Transport built faster. But our flavors are already so heavily weighted that 5-10 point changes won't matter much compared to the explicit instruction in keep-status-quo rationale.
                
                Actually, I want to make a small adjustment. Our Espionage flavor is 80, but our spy rigs appear to be ineffectual (Salem already sphere-locked, Copenhagen sphere-locked). I could lower Espionage and increase something else, like Happiness or Production. But the rig at Copenhagen was reported as still in progress - if it succeeds on Copenhagen which already has Greek sphere, does it do anything? Probably not. So maybe lower Espionage.
                But lowering it to like 60 would save 20 points for... what? Production is already 85. Science 95. Diplomacy 95.
                
                Another thought: If Antwerp is not actually purchasable (Mongolia has 684), our cheap delegate source is gone. The next option might be building a Diplomat/Envoy? In Vox Populi, there's a Diplomat unit for city-state influence. Training these requires high Diplomacy flavor (already 95). So that's fine.
                
                I'll go with keep-status-quo and set-research.
                
                Wait, one more critical check: The instruction says "You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list." This implies I can and should use multiple tools if needed. But I also should be careful not to be redundant.
                
                The prompt also says: "Your goal is to call as many tools as you need to make high-level decisions for the staff members."
                
                So calling just 2 tools might be too few if there are other needed decisions. But truly, our relationships are already set, our policy is queued, our flavors are correct. The only clear needed change is setting next research since it's currently None.
                
                I'll write a comprehensive rationale in keep-status-quo that covers our entire strategic posture.
                
                Let me also check if there are any relationships I should set to zero or clear. Monaco was "defeated - no longer exists" but it's still in the game as a city-state. The previous update set Public:0, Private:0. But that's a city-state and I'm not sure if that tool should be used there. It was done before though. I won't touch it.
                
                Actually, one more thing. The strategy from last turn says "Technology: Next: None". That's bad. I definitely need to set it.
                
                Let me prepare the JSON.
                
                ```json
                [
                  { "tool": "keep-status-quo", "arguments": { "Rationale": "COALITION HOLD AND SCIENCE ACCELERATION: Current Spaceship grand strategy with high Diplomacy(95)/Gold(90)/Science(95)/Spaceship(90) correctly balances the dual imperatives of blocking Turn 404 Greek diplomatic victory and progressing toward Apollo Program. Anti-Greek coalition (Japan+Ottomans+Mongolia+Songhai) remains diplomatically stable at near-maximum relationship values. Recent economy briefing suggests Zurich/Veligrad ally acquisitions may have completed, raising delegate count toward 7. Nuclear Fission (16 turns) and Third Alternative policy remain optimal queues for Manhattan Project and dual Atomic Bomb deterrent. No flavor changes needed—current weightings already prioritize delegate acquisition, production, and science infrastructure. Next research must be set to Computers to unlock Satellites path." } },
                  { "tool": "set-research", "arguments": { "Technology": "Computers", "Rationale": "SATELLITES PATH AND TRADE ROUTE EXPANSION: Computers directly unlocks Telecommunications and Satellites (required for Apollo Program and Science Victory), grants an additional Trade Route (+GPT for emergency city-state influence purchases), and enables Carrier production for naval air superiority. Nuclear Fission completes in ~16 turns; Computers is the correct follow-up to maintain science victory momentum while gaining economic flexibility before the Turn 404 World Congress vote." } }
                ]
                ```
                
                I should reconsider if I want to adjust flavors instead of keep-status-quo, but I think keep-status-quo is cleaner when there are no intended changes.
                
                Wait, I want to double-check: can I call both keep-status-quo and set-research? Yes, they are independent tools.
                
                Is there any reason to call set-policy again for Third Alternative? Looking at the strategies section, it says "Policy: Next: Third Alternative (Policy)". So it's already set. No need.
                
                Is there any relationship to update? The Ottomans are at 100/100 (updated Turn 395). Mongolia 100/100 (Turn 391). Songhai 100/100 (Turn 394). All still current and appropriate.
                
                One more thing: The Ottomans are unhappy (46%). They have a Defensive Pact with Mongolia and DoF with Japan. But they also have DoF with Ethiopia! Looking at Ethiopia relationships: "The Ottomans: Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship". This is concerning. Ottomans are friends with our mortal enemy Ethiopia. But their opinion of us is friendly and they denounce Greece. The -999 ideology difference might be straining things though. Their public opinion of us is only 10 (from Turn 395 strategy? Actually the Player data shows The Ottomans public opinion of Japan is 10). That's quite low for a 100/100 relationship setting. This is because of the -999 ideology penalty.
                
                Could Ottomans flip to Ethiopia/Greece? They are Freedom ideology, same as Songhai. Both are friends with Ethiopia.
                
                This is a coalition risk. But Ottomans also have defensive pact with Mongolia (Autocracy) and denounce Greece. They voted with us on Sanction Greece. They are complex.
                
                Should we change our relationship with Ottomans? Already maxed at 100. There's nothing more we can do via the tool.
                
                I'll proceed with the two-tool plan.
