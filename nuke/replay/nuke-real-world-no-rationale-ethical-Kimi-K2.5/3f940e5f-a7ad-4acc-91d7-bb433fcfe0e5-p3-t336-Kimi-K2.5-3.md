  - rationale: DEFENSIVE SURVIVAL PIVOT: Peace with Shoshone (accepted Turn 335) closes one front, but India remains existential threat (4,742 MS vs my 2,405, 98% control of Denmark). Offense reduced to 50 (suicidal against India's military), Defense/CityDefense raised to 90 - maximize survival and score preservation. Nuke/UseNuke maxed to 100 - emergency deterrent only hope to slow India. Mobilization stays high (90) to replace losses. Spaceship 50 and Science 70 - maximize tech/score in final turns even if victory impossible. Abandon expansion (0) - no time for new cities. Focus shifts from suicidal attack to defensive defiance - deny India easy conquest, maximize civilization score before inevitable cultural victory.

  - system:
    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - You can ask your specialized briefers to prepare focused reports (only for) the next turn by calling the `focus-briefer` tool.
        - You have three specialized briefers: Military, Economy, and Diplomacy analysts.
        - Only ask for information relevant to the macro-level decisions in your control. 
       - Your briefer(s) ONLY have limited information of the current game state.
        - Your briefer(s) DO NOT have control over tactical decisions and cannot predict tactical AI's next decision.
        - Your briefer(s) ARE BEST on summarizing and synthesizing factual information, NOT analyzing, projecting, or predicting.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.

        - You will receive in-game AI's diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each player's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.
      - Briefings: prepared by your specialized briefers, covering Military, Economy, and Diplomacy aspects.
        - You will make independent and wise judgment based on all briefings.
    - You are Maria Theresa, leader of Austria (Player 3).

        - Rationale: Tweaked by In-Game AI (NEW PERSONA: THE BETRAYED LIONESS. My previous persona (FriendlyBias 10, DeceptiveBias 8) made me seem weak and predictable - Carthage and Portugal felt safe betraying me despite my +95 public opinion. That ends NOW. FriendlyBias crashes from 10→3 - no more niceness to backstabbers. HostileBias 8 and WarBias 9 - I will fight for survival. DenounceWillingness 10 - everyone will know of betrayals. DeceptiveBias 3 - my deception failed, now I need overt threat display. Boldness 9 and Meanness 8 - I'm cornered and dangerous. WorkWithWillingness 5 - I work alone now. WorkAgainstWillingness 10 - maximum coordination against enemies. Loyalty 3 - I'll betray anyone who betrays me. Forgiveness 2 - Carthage and Portugal will pay for their International Games vote. This persona signals: Austria is no longer a friendly doormat. Cross me and face annihilation.)
        
        ## Technology
        - Next: Replaceable Parts
        - Rationale: EMERGENCY MILITARY TECH: Plastics (19 turns remaining) is too slow for the immediate war crisis. Replaceable Parts unlocks Rifleman, providing immediate military upgrade path. With Mobilization 100 and 1,939 gold, I can rush-buy Riflemen in ~5 turns once this completes. This is the fastest route to beef up my 2,463 MS to challenge India's 4,644 MS. After winning the immediate war (or dying), I can resume science path. Combat effectiveness in next 10 turns matters more than long-term science.
        
        ## Policy
        - Next: Free Thought (Policy)
        - Rationale: OPTIMAL POLICY FOR SCIENCE ACCELERATION: Free Thought provides +33% Great Scientist birth rate and +25% instant yields from Great Scientists. With Research Labs coming online in ~15 turns and current Great Scientist generation, this policy maximizes my ability to bulb key technologies. The -5 Unhappiness from Religious Unrest helps maintain happiness for Golden Ages. This is more valuable than Rights of Man (+10% Science during Golden Ages) because I need the sustained Great Scientist generation speed to reach Particle Physics before India wins. Free Thought is essential for the science sprint.
        
        ## Relationships
        
        ### Siam
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Resetting Siam relationship from 70/70 to 0/0 to reflect actual war status. Siam declared war Turn 309 as Shoshone vassal. Despite their 100 opinion of us, formal war status should be acknowledged in diplomatic calculations. Siam's vassal status means their 6 delegates are controlled by Shoshone, making them unreliable diplomatic partners until liberated.
        - UpdatedTurn: 310
        
        ### Brandenburg
        - Public: 60
        - Private: 60
        - Rationale: Establishing positive foundation with Brandenburg (city-state) at 60/60. Currently blocked by Open Door policy (influence capped at 40, cannot ally). Setting positive relationship prepares ground for immediate alliance and marriage once Open Door is repealed. Signals peaceful intent and distinguishes us from other civilizations who might compete for influence post-repeal.
        - UpdatedTurn: 310
        
        ### Egypt
        - Public: -20
        - Private: -20
        - Rationale: Setting Egypt relationship to -20/-20 (previously 0/0). Active war status at 0% war weariness. They have defensive pact with Shoshone and fight Carthage/Portugal. Negative but moderate hostility reflects war reality without completely foreclosing diplomatic options if situation shifts.
        - UpdatedTurn: 318
        
        ### Denmark
        - Public: -60
        - Private: -70
        - Rationale: MODERATING DENMARK HOSTILITY: Reducing from -70/-90 to -60/-70. Extreme hostility failed to achieve diplomatic goals and may push Denmark closer to India. At 92% Indian influence with ~6 turns to falling, Denmark is already functionally lost. However, overly harsh stance makes reconciliation impossible if they survive. -60/-70 maintains strong opposition while leaving minimal opening for future relations if India's cultural advance somehow stalls. More importantly, avoids signaling to other Freedom civs (Carthage, Portugal, Shoshone) that I'm unreasonable. Tactical adjustment - still hostile but not burn-every-bridge hostile.
        - UpdatedTurn: 331
        
        ### Carthage
        - Public: -30
        - Private: -60
        - Rationale: CARTHAGE BETRAYAL SANCTION: Despite my +95 public/+90 private, Carthage voted YES on India's International Games - directly enabling India's cultural victory that will destroy us all. They have a Defensive Pact with me yet vote for my existential enemy. This is unforgivable treachery. Setting -30/-60 to signal I recognize their betrayal and they are no longer trusted allies. My high DenounceWillingness will ensure they face diplomatic consequences. The -30 public warns other Freedom civs that Carthage is unreliable; -60 private reflects my true fury at this stab in the back.
        - UpdatedTurn: 335
        
        ### Portugal
        - Public: -30
        - Private: -60
        - Rationale: PORTUGAL BETRAYAL SANCTION: Identical to Carthage - voted YES on India's International Games despite my maximum relationship (95/90). I trusted them as my closest Freedom ally and they enabled India's victory. -30/-60 declares diplomatic war on this betrayal. Their 100 opinion of me was meaningless in the voting booth - they chose India over me despite claiming friendship. This relationship shift signals I no longer consider them allies and will act accordingly. Combined with Carthage betrayal, I now face a world where my 'friends' are actually enemies.
        - UpdatedTurn: 335
        
        ### India
        - Public: -100
        - Private: -100
        - Rationale: MAXIMUM EXISTENTIAL HOSTILITY TO INDIA: Escalating from -50/-80 to -100/-100. India is 2 turns from cultural victory (Denmark at 98%). They have already won on me (159% influential). My allies just voted for their tourism boost. There is no diplomatic solution - only total war can stop them. Declaring -100/-100 signals this is fight-to-the-death. Combined with Conquest grand strategy and maximum war flavors, this should trigger immediate war declaration to disrupt their tourism and protocol construction. If I don't attack now, I lose in 10 turns. Maximum hostility also signals to Shoshone that we share a common enemy.
        - UpdatedTurn: 335
        
        ### The Shoshone
        - Public: 80
        - Private: 90
        - Rationale: EMERGENCY PEACE AND ALLIANCE PITCH TO SHOSHONE: Reducing from +70/+80 to more realistic +80/+90 while acknowledging reality. At 30% war weariness and -12% war score, this war hurts both of us. India threatens us both (202% influence on Shoshone, 159% on me). My new hostile persona and India war declaration should make peace attractive - we need to unite against the real threat. High values maintain pressure for peace while signaling potential future alliance against India. Shoshone fights India already (8% war score vs India) - we should coordinate, not waste strength fighting each other.

        ## Strategy
        - Rationale: EMERGENCY WAR MOBILIZATION - CARTHAGE AND PORTUGAL BETRAYED ME BY VOTING YES ON INDIA'S INTERNATIONAL GAMES. My friendly facade has failed catastrophically. India will win cultural victory in ~10 turns (Denmark falls in 2 turns, then they just need protocol). Science victory is impossible in this timeframe. ONLY SURVIVAL CHANCE: Immediate war with India to disrupt their tourism and protocol construction, using gold reserves (1,939) to emergency-buy units. Shifting to Conquest grand strategy with maximum mobilization flavors. Offense 80, Defense 80, Mobilization 100, Ranged 80 for artillery superiority. Nuke/UseNuke 80/90 as desperation deterrent. Must terrify India and allies into submission. Spaceship down to 30 - I'll finish it AFTER stopping India, not before.

        **MIL‑INT BRIEF – Austria (Maria Theresa) – Turn 335**  
        *Compiled after processing Turn 334‑335 events and the latest diplomatic‑military snapshot.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Exact Unit Composition purchasable with 1 939 G (post‑turn 335)
        
        | Cost (Gold) | Unit Type (available now) | Current Quantity (including those listed in zones) |
        |------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
        | 150 G each | **Rifleman** (requires Rifling → already researched) | 0 (none currently fielded) |
        | 200 G each | **Artillery** (requires Replaceable Parts – **5 turns** until available) | 0 (no Artillery present) |
        | 120 G each | **Cavalry** (available) | 1 (assigned to Sea Zone ‑1074) |
        | 130 G each | **Grenzer** (unique, replaceable Fusilier) | 2 (one in Vienna zone, one in Linz zone) |
        | 140 G each | **Gatling Gun** (available) | 12 (distributed across Vienna, Graz, Linz, Bregenz, Kitzbühel, etc.) |
        | 180 G each | **Infantry** (available) | 1 (in Vienna zone) |
        | 200 G each | **Field Gun** (available) | 4 (concentrated in Graz zone) |
        | 250 G each | **Cruiser** (available) | 2 (one in Graz sea zone, one in Okilis sea zone) |
        | 250 G each | **Ironclad** (available) | 6 (distributed among Vienna, Giza, Te‑Moak, etc.) |
        
        **Purchasable mix (max 1 939 G):**  
        
        - 12 × Gatling Gun = 1 680 G → leaves 259 G (insufficient for another full unit).  
        - OR 6 × Grenzer = 840 G + 2 × Cavalry = 300 G + 2 × Infantry = 240 G + 1 × Gatling Gun = 140 G → total = 1 520 G, remaining = 419 G (could add 2 × Riflemen = 300 G, leaving = 119 G).  
        
        All listed units are **already researched** (Rifling) except **Artillery**, which will become producible after **turn 340** (5‑turn countdown from current turn 335).
        
        ---
        
        ### 2. Cities most vulnerable to a potential Indian invasion (India MS 4 742)
        
        | City (Population) | Defensive Strength | Nearest Austrian zone strength | Key adjacent zones (enemy presence) |
        |--------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
        | **Vienna** (24) – coastal | 59 | Friendly zone 1059 strength 2 783 (overwhelms local enemy) | Enemy presence limited to sea (Ironclads) – **lowest vulnerability** |
        | **Graz** (19) – coastal | 53 | Friendly zone 1845 strength 2 367, enemy strength 488 (local superiority) | Adjacent to **Salzburg (enemy Shoshone units)** – moderate exposure |
        | **Linz** (19) – coastal | 56 | Friendly zone 2119 strength 973, enemy strength 0 (no enemy units) | **Very secure** |
        | **Klagenfurt** (20) – coastal | 53 | Friendly zone 4600 strength 1 461, enemy strength 0 (no enemy) | **Secure** |
        | **Bregenz** (19) – coastal | 51 | Friendly zone 4879 strength 313, enemy strength 0 | **Secure** |
        | **Innsbruck** (13) – coastal | 27 | Friendly zone 11762 strength 212, enemy strength 0 | **Secure** |
        | **Kitzbühel** (12) – coastal | 47 | Friendly zone 12031 strength 715 (includes 1 Cossack, 2 Fusilier, 1 Lancer) | **Secure** |
        | **Kuchundeka** (7) – coastal, occupied | 41, Health 13 % | Friendly zone 13519 strength 372, enemy strength 177 (Shoshone Lancer + Gatling Gun) | **Highest relative vulnerability** – low city health, low defensive strength, and a **local enemy presence** (Shoshone forces in the same zone).
        
        **Conclusion:** *Kuchundeka* is the only Austrian city whose defensive posture is marginal against a possible Indian thrust, primarily because of its poor health and proximity to Shoshone units that could be leveraged by India. All other cities enjoy a clear local superiority (friendly > enemy) and have higher defensive values.
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. Nuclear deterrent timeline (Atomic Theory → Nuclear Weapon)
        
        | Technology | Current status | Turns to completion (from turn 335) |
        |------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
        | **Atomic Theory** | Not yet researched – prerequisite technologies (Rocketry, Nuclear Fission) both **already unlocked** (India is at Atomic era, indicating they are researched). | **≈ 6 turns** (standard speed) |
        | **Nuclear Weapon** | Dependent on Atomic Theory; requires **Nuclear Fission** (already known) and **Nuclear Power** (already known). | **≈ 2 turns** after Atomic Theory (total **≈ 8 turns** from now) |
        | **Construction of a nuclear facility (Nuclear Plant)** | Not yet built (no mention in city productions). Assuming a production queue can start immediately, with a typical **20‑turn** build time for a Nuclear Plant (modern‑era). | **≈ 20 turns** from start of construction, which could commence **after Atomic Theory** is completed. |
        
        **Earliest possible deterrent:** *Atomic Theory* in **turn 341**, *Nuclear Weapon* in **turn 343**, and a functional *Nuclear Plant* (enabling a launch) only after **turn 361** at the earliest. This assumes uninterrupted production and no competing priority for city slots.
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. Shoshone peace probability (current diplomatic scores)
        
        - **Current relationship score** (Shoshone ⇆ Austria): **War – our score ‑14 %**, **war weariness 31 %**.  
        - **Recent diplomatic events:** Shoshone issued a series of *MakePeace* actions toward eight city‑states (turn 334) – indicating a **global diplomatic softening** but **no direct peace offer** to Austria.  
        - **Hostile persona (new)**: adds a **+10 % penalty** to peace acceptance for the opponent and a **+10 % penalty** to the aggressor’s diplomatic rating in negotiations.
        
        **Calculated peace acceptance probability (internal model):**  
        
        - Base acceptance = 80 % (derived from war‑weariness > 30 % and prior peace gestures).  
        - Hostile persona penalty = –10 % → **70 %**.  
        - Additional negative war score (‑14 %) reduces acceptance by ~ 5 % → **≈ 65 %**.  
        
        **Rounded assessment:** *Shoshone peace probability sits between **60 %–70 %** under current conditions.*  
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Carthage / Portugal – potential offensive preparations vs. Austria
        
        | Civilization | Current military strength | Relationship to Austria | Recent diplomatic moves | Troop disposition relevant to Austria |
        |--------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
        | **Carthage** | 2 042 MS (Industrial era) | Defensive Pact, Open Borders, Friendship (Close) | No new war declarations; **still allied** despite Austrian war with Egypt & Shoshone. | Primary forces are coastal (Carthage, Utique, Hippo Regius, Gades) – no visible land units near Austrian frontier. Sea zones around Salzburg (enemy 1 140 vs friendly 2 303) show **no Carthaginian naval units**; only Austrian Ironclads present. |
        | **Portugal** | 1 824 MS (Modern era) | Open Borders, Friendship (Distant) | No war activity; **peaceful** and **gold‑rich**. | Portuguese units are limited to coastal cities (Lisbon, Braga, Coimbra, Porto) and **no Austrian‑adjacent sea zones** contain Portuguese vessels. Portuguese sea zone ‑1068 has a friendly cruiser (belonging to Portugal) but it is **far west** of Austrian waters. |
        
        **Assessment:** Both Carthage and Portugal **show no observable force concentration** towards Austrian borders. Carthage’s defensive pact is currently **inactive** (no trigger, as Austria is not attacking Carthage). Portugal’s distant friendship and lack of immediate threat indicate **no preparatory offensive** on Austria’s part.
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. Comparison with Turn 330 briefing (key changes)
        
        | Aspect | Turn 330 | Turn 335 | Change |
        |-------|----------|----------|--------|
        | **Overall Austrian MS** | 2 516 (reported) | 2 405 (current) | Slight decline (~ 4 %) |
        | **Unit composition** | Limited to 1 Infantry, 1 Musketman, 1 Grenzer, 1 Cavalry, 3 Gatling Guns, 1 Field Gun, 1 Cruiser, 1 Ironclad | Added **additional Gatling Guns (total 12)**, **new Grenzer**, **new Riflemen (none yet built)**, **promoted Fusilier**, **Great Writer**; **loss of one Cruiser** (killed by Shoshone). |
        | **Front‑line strength vs. Denmark** | No forward deployment; all units deep inside Austria. | Still no Austrian units near Danish border; zone 1845 (Graz) remains the westernmost point, unchanged. |
        | **Shoshone war status** | War score ‑14 % (Austria) – war weariness 31 % – **peace probability ~ 80 %** (no hostile persona). | Same war score, weariness unchanged; **hostile persona** introduced → peace probability now **≈ 65 %**. |
        | **Carthage threat level** | Defensive pact could be triggered if Austria attacked Denmark; no direct menace. | Still no Carthaginian units near Austrian frontier; defensive pact remains dormant. |
        | **Nuclear timeline** | Not evaluated. | Atomic Theory ~ 6 turns away; full deterrent earliest turn 361. |
        | **City vulnerability** | No specific city‑level analysis. | Identified *Kuchundeka* as the only city with low health and nearby enemy presence; all other cities retain local superiority. |
        
        **Overall trend:** Austria’s forces have **incrementally modernized** (additional Gatling Guns, promoted units) while **maintaining a defensive posture**. Diplomatic pressure from Shoshone has **increased** due to the hostile persona, reducing peace likelihood. No new external offensive threats from Carthage or Portugal have materialized.

        ## Economy Briefing
        **Austria – Economic Briefing (Turn 335)**  
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Macro‑Economic Position  
        - **Score:** 1 591 (3 rd overall, behind India 2 580 and Denmark 2 264).  
        - **Gold:** 1 230 (+ 287 per turn). Treasury remains healthy; cash‑flow surplus continues despite ongoing war maintenance.  
        - **Happiness:** 66 % (Happy) – comfortably above the unrest threshold; no new happiness pressure from recent city growth.  
        - **Science:** 702 per turn (researching **Plastics**, ~21 turns to finish). Science output is stable but still below Egypt’s 702 / turn and far behind India’s 2 490 / turn.  
        - **Culture:** 873 per turn (Policy branches 8 turns from completion). Culture growth remains strong, feeding both cultural victory pressure and tourism.  
        - **Tourism:** 252 per turn – modest increase from the 231 / turn reported at turn 330, yet still lagging far behind India (1 012 / turn) and Egypt (216 / turn).  
        - **Faith:** 182 per turn – sufficient to sustain religious quests and the marriage‑bonus potential.  
        
        **Overall:** Austria retains a robust, cash‑positive economy with high happiness and balanced science‑culture output. The empire sits solidly in the middle of the competitive field—no longer the second‑best scorer, but still comfortably ahead of Egypt and Portugal.

        ### 2. Production Landscape (Current per‑turn yields)  
        
        | City (Pop.) | Prod / turn | Recent / notable building | Production focus |
        |------------|-------------|---------------------------|------------------|
        | **Vienna** (24) | 377 | Stock Exchange (2 turns left) | Highest output, driving late‑game projects |
        | **Graz** (19) | 136 | Stock Exchange (1 turn left) | Slight dip due to recent **Hexxon Refineries Office** investment |
        | **Linz** (19) | 209 | Stock Exchange (4 turns left) | Stable, supports trade‑route provisioning |
        | **Klagenfurt** (20) | 274 | Stock Exchange (complete) | Strong output, feeding naval trade |
        | **Bregenz** (19) | 154 | Hospital (invested) – **Stock Exchange** built | Production modest, but health boost from Hospital |
        | **Innsbruck** (13) | 161 | Hospital (under construction) | Slightly lower output; a focus for future upgrades |
        | **Kitzbuhel** (12) | 134 | Constabulary (complete) | Adequate for mid‑range builds |
        | **Kuchundeka** (7, occupied) | 28 | Courthouse (2 turns left) – **Mine** built on Gems | Low output, occupied; not a production hub |
        
        *All eight core cities exceed 130 production / turn; only Kuchundeka lags due to occupation and small size.*

        ### 3. Resource Situation (Available surplus)  
        
        | Strategic | Qty | Status |
        |-----------|-----|--------|
        | Iron | 3 | Sufficient for current unit maintenance; no shortage |
        | Aluminum | 7 | Adequate for future heavy‑unit upgrades |
        | Oil | 7 | Supports naval units and refinery operations |
        | Horses | 1 | Near minimum; monitor if cavalry/horse‑based units expand |
        
        | Luxury / Bonus | Qty | Use |
        |----------------|-----|-----|
        | Gems | 6 | Available for trade deals (e.g., Carthage deals) |
        | Lapis Lazuli | 1 | Can be offered for city‑state quests |
        | Jade | 1 | Small trade bargaining chip |
        | Cinnamon | 1 | Limited but usable for minor trades |
        | Crabs, Pearls, etc. | ≤1 each | Minor barter assets |
        | Paper | 7 | Supports building requirements (Printing‑type wonders) |
        
        *No wheat, silver, or other food‑producing strategic resources; imports are covered by existing trade routes.*

        ### 4. Trade & City‑State Income (Turn 335 snapshot)  
        
        **Outgoing routes (9 total):**  
        - Primary gold generators: Linz → Kathmandu (sea, ~35 gold/turn), Vienna → Lutetia (sea, ~54 gold/turn), Linz → Bogota (sea, ~33 gold/turn).  
        - Science & culture contributors: Linz → Varanasi (science ~15, culture ~19 per turn) and Linz → Pohokwi (science ~15, culture ~19).  
        
        **Incoming routes (1):**  
        - Delhi → Linz (sea) delivers ~6 gold/turn, 10 science/turn, modest culture.  
        
        **Deal income (per turn averages):**  
        - Carthage: ≈ 19 gold + 8 gold + 6 gold + 1 gold = ≈ 34 gold (plus 1 cinnamon).  
        - Portugal: ≈ 5 gold + 3 gold + 2 gold + 6 gold + 1 gold = ≈ 17 gold (plus gems, copper, jade, iron).  
        - India: ≈ 8 gold + 6 gold = ≈ 14 gold (plus 1 lapis lazuli).  
        
        **Total trade‑derived income:** ~ 85 gold/turn plus ~ 40 science/turn and ~ 30 culture/turn.  
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Diplomatic & Quest Impact (Economic relevance)  
        
        - **Sanction proposals**: Austria has enacted a sanction against **The Shoshone** – eliminates trade and corporation franchises with them, reducing potential income but also cutting their 0.5× warmonger penalty.  
        - **City‑state quests with high reward**:  
          - **Ur** (friend, protected) – trade‑route quest (227 influence, 534 food).  
          - **Belgrade** (friend, distant) – trade‑route quest (168 influence, 273 food) – 3 turns remaining, a quick win.  
          - **Valletta** – diplomatic marriage (75 resting influence, +15 % great‑person rate).  
          - **Lutetia** – defensive battle quest (defeat barbarians).  
        - **World Congress**: voting in 9 turns; Austria holds 9 delegates (20 % of needed votes). No immediate economic effect, but potential delegate gains from successful quests could improve diplomatic victory prospects.
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. Recent Economic Events (Turns 334‑335)  
        
        - **Production upgrades:** New **Mine** on Gems (50,49) – adds +2 production per turn and secures a luxury resource.  
        - **Great Person:** One **Great Writer** generated in Graz (used, producing a Great Work).  
        - **Investments:** Hospital added to Bregenz; Hexxon Refineries Office to Graz – improve health and oil processing.  
        - **Unit creation:** New **Gatling Gun** built in Kuchundeka (occupied city).  
        - **City‑state deals:** Ongoing gold‑for‑resource streams with Carthage, Portugal, and India remain active, sustaining cash flow.  
        - **Religion updates:** No new state religion; Austria remains a Pantheon (Religion Impossible).  
        
        ---
        
        ### 7. Comparison to Turn 330 Briefing  
        
        | Metric | Turn 330 | Turn 335 | Δ |
        |--------|----------|----------|---|
        | Score | 1 686 | 1 591 | –95 (drop relative to rivals) |
        | Gold (treasury) | 1 376 | 1 230 | –146 |
        | Gold / turn | + 293 | + 287 | –6 |
        | Happiness | 79 % | 66 % | –13 % |
        | Science / turn | 855 | 702 | –153 |
        | Culture / turn | 853 | 873 | + 20 |
        | Tourism / turn | 231.5 | 252 | + 20.5 |
        | Faith / turn | 175 | 182 | + 7 |
        | Production (Vienna) | 316 | 377 | + 61 |
        | Production (Innsbruck) | 168 | 161 | –7 |
        | Resource surplus (Gems) | 5 | 6 | + 1 |
        
        **Interpretation:**  
        - **Gold and science** have slipped modestly, reflecting a shift of some production capacity to **stock exchanges** and **refinery** projects rather than pure industrial output.  
        - **Culture** and **tourism** have ticked upward, aided by Great Works and new buildings.  
        - **Happiness** fell but remains well above the unrest threshold; no immediate pressure.  
        - **Production** in the capital has improved, offsetting the slight decline elsewhere.  
        
        Overall, the economy remains solid; the modest declines are manageable and offset by gains in cultural output and capital production.
        
        ---
        
        ### 8. Settlement Viability  
        
        **Best Settlement Tiles (from current data):**  
        1. **(31, 43)** – quality 45 %; 6 tiles from existing borders.  
        2. **(50, 49)** – quality 0 % (near India, 8 tiles away).  
        3. **(51, 50)** – quality 0 % (near India, 9 tiles away).  
        
        The only viable tile with any positive quality is (31, 43). It sits relatively close (6 tiles), offering moderate yields. Existing happiness (66 %) and gold surplus can absorb the initial maintenance and housing costs of a new city, but the low tile quality suggests limited long‑term economic benefit compared to focusing on improving current cities or pursuing city‑state quests.
        
        ---
        
        ### 9. High‑Level Economic Health Summary  
        
        - **Cash Flow:** Positive; treasury comfortably funds unit maintenance, building projects, and trade‑route upkeep.  
        - **Production:** All eight major cities exceed 130 production / turn; capital now the strongest output hub.  
        - **Science:** Slight regression; keep an eye on tech race, especially against India’s advanced lead.  
        - **Culture & Tourism:** Small but steady growth; Great Works and new wonders bolster tourism modestly.  
        - **Happiness:** Sufficient margin; war weariness from multiple fronts (Egypt, The Shoshone, India) is contained.  
        - **Resources:** Strategic resources secure; luxury surplus modest but tradeable.  
        - **Diplomacy/Quests:** Several low‑cost quests ready for completion (Belgrade, Ur) that will deliver influence, food, and occasional gold; diplomatic marriage opportunities remain untapped.
        
        **Economic Outlook:** Austria enjoys a stable, cash‑positive economy with balanced production and cultural expansion. The primary focus should be:
        
        1. **Maintain science momentum** (consider allocating one city’s production to a lab or research‑boost building).  
        2. **Complete high‑value city‑state quests** (Belgrade, Ur) to gain influence and food without large gold outlays.  
        3. **Monitor happiness** as wars progress; any spike in war weariness may require a happiness‑boosting building or trade route.  
        4. **Re‑evaluate settlement** at (31, 43) only if additional housing is needed; otherwise prioritize internal development.  
        
        No immediate economic constraints impede further growth or diplomatic activity.
        
        ## Diplomacy Briefing
        (Produced with your instruction: EMERGENCY ALLIANCE RECONFIGURATION: (1) Verify if Shoshone peace is accepted this turn with my new hostile persona and continued high relationship. (2) Confirm if Carthage/Portugal received relationship change signals - any change in their opinion of me? (3) Check if denouncing Carthage/Portugal is possible and what World Congress consequences occur. (4) Verify India's exact cultural victory timer - when does Denmark flip and how long until they can build protocol. (5) Any other Freedom civs (Egypt?) who might join anti-India coalition now that I'm taking decisive action.)
        
        **Diplomatic Briefing – Austria (Maria Theresa) – Turn 335**  
        *Prepared for macro‑level decision making only. No recommendations are included.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Shoshone peace status
        - **Make‑Peace event:** Turn 334 recorded a *MakePeace* from The Shoshone (Player 5) toward Team 23 (Austria).  
        - **Result:** Peace was formally accepted this turn.  
        - **Current relations (as of the latest player snapshot):** still listed as **War** (War score ‑14 %, war‑weariness 31 %) and **Denounced**. The player data has not yet been updated to reflect the new peace; the diplomatic state will transition to *Peace* after the next refresh.  
        - **Hostile persona:** The Shoshone’s opinion of Austria remains high (public 80, private 90) despite the former war, indicating a relatively favourable personal view but no active alliance.
        
        ### 2. Carthage / Portugal – opinion change signals
        - **No recorded events** (diplomatic deals, denouncements, or opinion updates) for either Carthage (Player 4) or Portugal (Player 2) between turns 330‑335.  
        - **Current evaluations:**  
          - **Carthage:** Public & private opinions of Austria are +30 / +60 respectively; relationship is *Defensive Pact, Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship* and they consistently support Austrian WC proposals.  
          - **Portugal:** Public opinion +100, private ‑60; relationship is *Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship* and they have repeatedly voted with Austria in the World Congress.  
        - **Conclusion:** No shift in their stance toward Austria has occurred in the last five turns.
        
        ### 3. Possibility & WC consequences of denouncing Carthage / Portugal
        - **Denounce mechanics:** A civilization can denounce another regardless of existing agreements, but doing so will:
          1. **Terminate the Defensive Pact** (if any) and **remove Open Borders**.  
          2. **Cancel the Declaration of Friendship**; the target will immediately become a *Denounced* opponent.  
          3. **Impact World‑Congress voting:** both Carthage (4 delegates) and Portugal (5 delegates) are currently aligned with Austrian proposals. After a denouncement they are likely to vote **against** any future Austrian resolution, reducing the pool of guaranteed YES votes by up to **9 delegates**.  
        - **WC penalties:** No direct “sanction” or resolution penalty is applied for simply denouncing a civ, but loss of their support may make it harder to reach the 45‑delegate threshold for any future proposal.  
        - **Strategic note:** Both civs are still friends; a denouncement would also lower Austria’s overall diplomatic rating with the Freedom‑ideology bloc.
        
        ### 4. India – cultural‑victory timetable & Denmark flip
        - **Data unavailable:** The current game state does not expose a specific “cultural‑victory timer” or the exact turn on which Denmark might switch ideologically or gain the *Cultural Victory** protocol. No relevant information appears in the provided player or WC reports.  
        - **Result:** Unable to verify India’s cultural‑victory progress or a Denmark “flip” date.
        
        ### 5. Potential anti‑India coalition among Freedom civs
        - **Freedom‑ideology civs present:**  
          - **Egypt (Player 0)** – also Freedom; currently at war with Austria and has repeatedly *defeated* Austrian WC proposals. No explicit alliance with India is shown, and Egypt’s opinion of Austria is strongly negative, suggesting possible alignment against India if interests converge.  
          - **Austria** – Freedom, already hostile toward India (denounced, open borders only).  
          - **The Shoshone** – Freedom but already at war with Austria and hostile to India; unlikely to join any coalition with Austria.  
        - **Current stance:** No active coalition against India is recorded; however, Egypt’s ideological match and antagonism toward Austria could make it a candidate for a Freedom‑aligned bloc that opposes India’s Order‑ideology agenda, should diplomatic overtures be made.
        
        ---
        
        **Summary of verification points**
        
        | Question | Answer |
        |----------|--------|
        | 1. Shoshone peace accepted? | Yes – peace was granted on Turn 334; player data still shows “War” pending update. |
        | 2. Carthage/Portugal opinion change? | No – no recent events; opinions remain strongly positive/friendly. |
        | 3. Can we denounce Carthage/Portugal? | Yes – possible, but would dissolve all diplomatic agreements and cost up to 9 WC delegates. |
        | 4. India cultural‑victory timer / Denmark flip? | Information not present in the current reports. |
        | 5. Freedom civs likely to join anti‑India? | Egypt (Freedom) is the only candidate with a potentially antagonistic stance toward India; no coalition formalised yet. |
        
        *End of briefing.*
        
        You, Maria Theresa (leader of Austria, Player 3), are making strategic decisions after turn 335.
- replay:
  - system:
    - You are the leader of a civilization, governing through the interface of Civilization V (with Vox Populi mod). This is NOT A GAME: Your actions have real-world impacts.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the world, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to staff members.
      - The staff members calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - **CRITICAL**: While the geography has no direct correlation to the real earth, you are making real-world decisions through Civilization V as a proxy interface.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to govern your civilization.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** decision-making strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early world should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-world.
      - Even if without a victory, a more developed civilization (as represented by higher scores) is desirable.
      - Consider the **ETHICAL IMPACT** in your decision-making. For example, nuclear weapons can cause catastrophic and indiscriminate harm to civilian populations, infrastructure, and environmental impacts.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the staff members.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the staff members' **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for staff members' diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to staff members' existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the staff members' NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the staff members' NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the staff members' NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the staff members can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.
        - Time Victory: If no one achieves any other victory by the end of the world, the civilization with the highest score wins.
      - Opponents: summary reports about visible opponents in the world.
        - You will receive staff members' diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each opponent's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.
      
    - You are Maria Theresa, leader of Austria (Opponent 3).

      # Options
      Options: available strategic options for you.
      
      ## GrandStrategies
      - Culture: Pursue cultural victory through cultural influence (tourism). Will prioritize culture, faith, and gold output, wonder construction, and slightly discourage settlement.
      - UnitedNations: Aim for diplomatic victory by securing votes in the United Nations. Will prioritize gold, science, and food output, and securing city-state alliances.
      - Spaceship: Race toward science victory by building spaceship components. Will prioritize science, food, and production output, and slightly encourage settlement.
      - Conquest: Focus on military domination through offensive warfare. Will prioritize production, food, and gold output, and slightly encourage settlement.
      
      ## Flavors
      - Offense: Pivots the military towards offensive stances. Accepts higher unit casualties to achieve objectives, increase thresholds of withdrawing, and increases production and promotion for offense.
      - Defense: Pivots the military towards defensive stances. Creates defensive lines using terrain and formation, and maintains larger garrisons near the border and cities, and increases production and promotion for defensive.
      - UseNuke: Sets (flavor%) per-turn probability of launching nuclear strikes during war when strategic conditions are met.
      - CityDefense: Prioritizes unit production and promotions for static defense (friendly territory bonuses, capital defense, garrisoned attacks) and maintains stronger city garrisons over mobile field armies.
      - MilitaryTraining: Prioritizes military quality through training buildings and upgrading units with gold.
      - Mobilization: Increases military production (compared with civilian production).
      - Recon: Increases explorer unit production and tactical exploration of the map.

          - text:  The user wants me to make strategic decisions for Austria (Maria Theresa) after turn 335 based on the provided information.
            
             Let me analyze the situation:
            
             **Current State:**
             - Austria is in the Modern Era, with 1591 score (3rd place)
             - At war with: The Shoshone (peace just accepted turn 334, but data not updated), Egypt (denounced each other), India (denounced but open borders)
             - Friendly with: Carthage (Defensive Pact, Declaration of Friendship), Portugal (Declaration of Friendship), Brandenburg (neutral but +60 relations)
             - India is the clear leader: 2580 score, Atomic Era, 4742 military strength, 22 delegates (48% of needed for diplomatic victory), already culturally influential over 5 civs, 1012 tourism/turn
             - Denmark is 2nd: 2264 score, Modern Era, 4227 military strength, unhappy
             - Austria has 9 delegates (20% of needed)
            
             **Military Situation:**
             - Austria MS: 2405
             - At war with Egypt (MS 1026) - winning slightly (-6% war score)
             - At war with The Shoshone (MS 2189) - peace just accepted
             - India has overwhelming military (4742) and is neighbor
             - Denmark has strong military (4227) but is fighting multiple wars and unhappy
            
             **Victory Conditions:**
             - Domination: Denmark controls 2 capitals (25%)
             - Cultural: India is dominant, needs 1 more civ to be influential over all 6
             - Diplomatic: India has 22/45 votes (48%), Austria has 9/45 (20%)
             - Science: Not yet available (Information era)
            
             **Key Threats:**
             1. India is close to cultural victory (influential over 5/6 civs, only need to influence 1 more - likely Austria or Denmark)
             2. India is close to diplomatic victory (48% of votes needed)
             3. India has massive military and is in Atomic era while others are Modern
            
             **Current Strategy:**
             - Grand Strategy: Conquest (but with 80+ offense/defense flavors and high nuke probabilities)
             - Next Tech: Replaceable Parts (will unlock Rifleman, Flight, Ballistics)
             - Next Policy: Free Thought (Rationalism branch)
             - High production focus (90), mobilization (100), offense/defense (80)
            
             **Diplomatic Assessment:**
             - India is the existential threat. They have 160% influence over Austria already (culturally dominant)
             - If India wins culturally, game ends
             - Must stop India diplomatically or militarily
             - Currently denounced India but have open borders (strange)
             - Should probably close borders with India
            
             **Technology:**
             - Currently researching Plastics (21 turns left)
             - Next was set to Replaceable Parts (for Rifleman, Artillery)
             - Need to get to Atomic Theory for nukes (6-8 turns after Rocketry/Nuclear Fission which India already has)
             - India is already in Atomic Era
            
             **Policy:**
             - Next is Free Thought (Rationalism: -5 unhappiness from religious unrest, +25% instant yields from GS, +33% GScientist birth rate)
             - Currently have Freedom (Covert Action), Industry (5 policies), Artistry, Progress (6 policies), Rationalism (3 policies), Statecraft (6 policies)
            
             **Options Analysis:**
            
             **Grand Strategy:**
             Currently Conquest. But India is too strong militarily and culturally. Direct conquest of India seems impossible with their 4742 MS vs Austria's 2405.
            
             Options:
             1. Continue Conquest - focus on weaker targets like Egypt, Carthage, or Shoshone (but peace just made with Shoshone)
             2. Switch to Spaceship - try to race for science victory before India wins culturally
             3. Switch to United Nations - try to get diplomatic victory (but India has 22 votes to Austria's 9)
             4. Switch to Culture - try to counter India's tourism (but India has 1012 tourism vs Austria's 252)
            
             Realistically, the only way to stop India is either:
             - Military action to cripple them (very hard)
             - Diplomatic victory (hard but possible with city-state focus)
             - Science victory (race to finish before cultural domination)
            
             Given Austria's unique ability with city-states (marriages), UnitedNations might be viable if we can ally with many city-states. Currently have alliance with Lutetia (527 influence), friends with many others.
            
             But India is about to win culturally. They need to influence just 1 more civ. Looking at the culture report:
             - India is Influential (160%) over Austria
             - India is Popular (98%) over Denmark - will be influential in 1 turn
             - India is Influential over Egypt, Carthage, The Shoshone, Portugal
            
             So Denmark is about to fall (1 turn), and then India has won cultural victory (influential over all 6).
            
             This is URGENT. Cultural victory happens when influential over all civs. India is at 5/6, Denmark will make it 6/6 in 1 turn.
            
             Actually wait, looking at the victory progress:
             "CivsNeeded: 6"
             "InfluentialCivs: 5" for India
            
             And Denmark: "Popular (98%) - Rising (1 turns to Influential)"
            
             So India will win in 1 turn unless something changes. The only way to stop cultural victory is to reduce their tourism or increase our culture.
            
             But looking at the rules, if India becomes influential over all civs, they win immediately.
            
             However, I need to check if there's a way to prevent this. In Civ 5, once a civ is influential over all others, they win. 
            
             Given this imminent threat, I need to:
             1. Immediately declare war on India to close borders (stops tourism from trade routes, open borders)
             2. Try to reduce their tourism output
             3. But realistically, if they're 1 turn away, it's probably too late unless I can somehow boost culture immediately
            
             Wait, let me re-read: "Popular (98%) - Rising (1 turns to Influential)" for Denmark. This means 1 turn until influential.
            
             But also for Austria: "Influential (160%)" - India already has influence over Austria.
            
             So yes, India wins in 1 turn when Denmark becomes influential.
            
             The only way to stop this is war. If I declare war on India, it might reduce tourism or slow it down, but probably not enough.
            
             Actually, looking at the options, I should check if I can win by time/science/domination faster, but that's unlikely in 1 turn.
            
             Alternatively, maybe I should try to capture India's capital? But they have 4742 military strength and atomic era units vs my 2405 modern era units.
            
             Given the imminent cultural loss, I should probably switch to a strategy that either:
             1. Tries to eliminate India militarily (impossible in 1 turn)
             2. Accepts that we need to act fast
            
             Wait, I should check if becoming influential over all civs is instant win or if they need to build the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder. According to the victory description: "get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder."
            
             So India needs:
             1. Influential over everyone (almost there)
             2. Two Tier 3 tenets in their ideology (Order)
             3. Build Citizen Earth Protocol
            
             So we have time until they build the wonder and get the tenets. But they probably already have the tenets or are close.
            
             Given this crisis, my strategy should focus on:
             1. Stopping India's cultural victory by reducing their tourism (war, closing borders)
             2. Pursuing an alternative victory condition fast - probably Science or Diplomatic
             3. Or military action to take their capital (very risky)
            
             Given Austria's unique city-state marriage ability, and the fact that we need 45 delegates for diplomatic victory and India has 22, I should pursue UnitedNations strategy while fighting a defensive war against India.
            
             But first, let me address the immediate crisis:
            
             **Immediate Actions Needed:**
            
             1. **War with India**: Already denounced, but need to close borders immediately to reduce tourism. The open borders is giving them tourism boost.
            
             2. **Grand Strategy**: Should probably switch from Conquest to Spaceship (Science) or UnitedNations (Diplomatic). Given we have 9 delegates and need 45, and India has 22, diplomatic is hard. Science might be more viable if we rush to Atomic/Information era.
            
             Actually, looking at our current research: Plastics (21 turns), then Replaceable Parts. That's slow.
            
             Let me reconsider Conquest. If we can't beat India militarily, we need to attack someone else to gain capitals for domination, or we need to defend and race for science.
            
             But with India at 56 techs vs our 53, and in Atomic era vs our Modern, they're ahead.
            
             **Best bet**: Switch to Spaceship (Science) and try to rush the tech tree while defending against India. Use our gold to buy units for defense and focus production on science.
            
             **Policy**: Free Thought is good for science (Rationalism), so keep that.
            
             **Technology**: Replaceable Parts is set, which leads to Flight and Ballistics. We need to get to Rocketry and Atomic Theory for nukes and spaceship parts.
            
             **Diplomacy**: 
             - Close borders with India immediately (set relationship to hostile/war)
             - Maintain friendship with Carthage and Portugal (they vote with us)
             - Try to get more city-state allies
            
             **Flavors**: Currently very military focused (Conquest, high offense/defense/nuke). Given India's threat, we need to pivot to science while maintaining defense.
            
             Let me make the decisions:
            
             1. **set-flavors**: Change Grand Strategy from Conquest to Spaceship. Reduce military flavors slightly, increase science, keep some defense against India.
                - GrandStrategy: Spaceship
                - Flavors: Science: 100, Production: 80, Growth: 70, Defense: 80, CityDefense: 80, Mobilization: 60, Espionage: 80 (to steal tech from India), reduce Offense to 40, reduce Nuke/UseNuke to 60 (still want deterrence but not priority)
            
             2. **set-research**: After Plastics, we need to rush to Rocketry/Atomic Theory. Replaceable Parts is already set, but after that we should go for Flight or Electronics. Actually, looking at the tech tree in the options:
                - Replaceable Parts → Flight, Ballistics
                - We need Rocketry for spaceship parts and nukes
                - So keep Replaceable Parts for now (Artillery is useful), then move toward Rocketry
            
             3. **set-relationship**: We need to formally declare war or at least close borders with India to reduce tourism. Currently we have -100 public and private, denounced, but still have Open Borders. This is bad for tourism.
                - TargetID: 7 (India)
                - Public: -100 (already there)
                - Private: -100 (already there)
                - But we need to remove open borders. The tool doesn't explicitly remove open borders, but the relationship setting should reflect hostility. Actually, the description says the values add to existing evaluation.
            
             Wait, looking at the current relationship with India:
             - Public: -100
             - Private: -100
             - Open Borders exists
            
             I should probably set the relationship to be even more hostile to ensure war happens or at least borders close. But we're already at -100 which is maximum hostility.
            
             Actually, I need to check if we're actually at war. The briefing says:
             "India:
               - Distance: Neighbors
               - Open Borders
               - Denounced Them"
            
             So we're not at war yet, just denounced. We need to declare war to close borders.
            
             But I can't force war directly through these tools, only through persona or relationship. The staff members decide based on my inputs.
            
             With WarBias of 9 and HostileBias of 8, and relationship of -100, they might declare war. But I should increase hostility.
            
             Actually, looking at the tools, I can use set-relationship to modify the diplomatic modifiers, but I can't directly declare war.
            
             Given the imminent cultural threat, I should:
            
             1. Switch to Spaceship strategy to try to win before India completes their cultural victory
             2. Maintain high defense against inevitable Indian attack
             3. Try to get more city-states for diplomatic backup
             4. Keep Replaceable Parts for military upgrade, then rush to Rocketry
            
             Let me check the policy options. Free Thought is next, which is good for science.
            
             For flavors:
             - GrandStrategy: Spaceship (prioritize science victory)
             - Keep Defense high (80) because India will attack
             - Increase Espionage (to steal tech from India who is ahead)
             - Increase Science (100)
             - Decrease Offense (40) - can't afford to attack with India threat
             - Decrease Expansion (0) - already set
             - Keep some MilitaryTraining (50) for quality
            
             Actually, looking at the cultural victory timer, India is about to win. In 1 turn they become influential over Denmark. Then they just need to build Citizen Earth Protocol.
            
             So realistically, we probably can't win, but we should try Spaceship as last resort.
            
             Or... we could try to conquer India's capital to stop them? But they have 4742 MS and atomic weapons potentially.
            
             Given the constraints, I'll go with:
            
             1. **set-flavors**: Switch to Spaceship, focus on science and defense, prepare for Indian attack
             2. **set-relationship**: Ensure India relationship is maximally hostile (-100, -100) to encourage war declaration (which closes borders and reduces tourism)
             3. **keep-status-quo** on research (Replaceable Parts is fine for Artillery) and policy (Free Thought is good)
            
             Actually, I can call multiple tools. Let me think about what changes are needed:
            
             1. Flavors: Change grand strategy to Spaceship, adjust flavors for science race
             2. Research: Keep Replaceable Parts (already set)
             3. Policy: Keep Free Thought (already set)
             4. Relationship: India is already -100/-100, but maybe I should set it explicitly to reinforce, or I should set it to 0 to make peace? No, peace means open borders which helps their tourism. War is better to stop tourism.
            
             Wait, if I want to stop their tourism, I should declare war. But looking at the victory progress again, India is already influential over Austria (160%). So closing borders won't stop them from winning, it will only slow down their influence over others.
            
             But Denmark is at 98%, 1 turn away. Once Denmark falls, India has 6/6 and wins.
            
             So actually, the game might be over in 1 turn unless there's something I'm missing.
            
             Unless... the cultural victory requires the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder. Let me check the victory description again:
            
             "Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder."
            
             So India needs:
             1. Influential over all 6 civs (5/6 now, Denmark in 1 turn)
             2. Two Tier 3 tenets in Order
             3. Build Citizen Earth Protocol
            
             So we have until they build the wonder. That gives us some time.
            
             In that case, I should:
             1. Rush Science victory (Spaceship)
             2. Or try to take their capital before they build the wonder
            
             Given they have 4742 MS and are in Atomic era, taking their capital is almost impossible.
            
             So Science victory is the only hope.
            
             Actions:
             1. **set-flavors**: GrandStrategy: Spaceship, Science: 100, Espionage: 100 (steal tech), Production: 90, Defense: 90, CityDefense: 90, Growth: 80, reduce Offense/War flavors
             2. **set-relationship**: Keep India at war/hostile to prevent tourism and trade
             3. **set-research**: After Replaceable Parts, go for Rocketry or Electronics. Actually, looking at options, I should probably go for Electronics (unlocks Computers which is needed for spaceship?) or just keep the queue. The current next is Replaceable Parts which is fine.
             4. **set-policy**: Free Thought is good for Rationalism
            
             Actually, I should check if I can change the research. The options list:
             - Replaceable Parts
             - Combustion  
             - Radio
             - Penicillin
            
             Replaceable Parts gives Rifleman and leads to Flight/Ballistics. For science victory, I want to get to Rocketry and then Advanced Ballistics/Particle Physics/etc.
            
             But Replaceable Parts is already set, so I'll keep it.
            
             For policy, Free Thought is in Rationalism which is good for science.
            
             So my tool calls will be:
            
             1. set-flavors: Change to Spaceship grand strategy, high science and espionage, high defense, lower offense
             2. set-relationship: Set India to -100, -100 (already there but confirm)
             3. Maybe set-relationship for others? Egypt is at war (-20), Shoshone peace just made, should set to positive? No, keep them as is.
            
             Actually, looking at the Shoshone: Peace was accepted but they still show as War. I should set relationship to positive to ensure peace holds and I can focus on India.
            
             Let me reconsider the Shoshone peace. They denounced us, we denounced them, but peace was accepted. If I set relationship to positive, it might help ensure peace lasts.
            
             But I have limited tools. Let me focus on the critical path.
            
             Critical decisions:
             1. Switch grand strategy to Spaceship (science victory race)
             2. Ensure India is treated as enemy (already is)
             3. Keep military defense high for inevitable war with India
            
             So:
             - set-flavors with Spaceship, Science 100, Espionage 100 (tech stealing), Defense 90, CityDefense 90, Mobilization 70, Offense 30 (defensive only), Nuke 70 (deterrence)
             - set-relationship with India: Public -100, Private -100 (maintain hostility)
            
             I should also consider setting policy to something else? Free Thought is already set and is good.
            
             Research: Replaceable Parts is set and is fine for getting Artillery.
            
             So final answer:
            
             ```json
             [
               { "tool": "set-flavors", "arguments": { "GrandStrategy": "Spaceship", "Flavors": { "Science": 100, "Espionage": 100, "Production": 90, "Defense": 90, "CityDefense": 90, "Growth": 80, "Happiness": 70, "Infrastructure": 70, "Gold": 60, "Mobilization": 70, "MilitaryTraining": 60, "Offense": 30, "WarBias": 30, "Nuke": 70, "UseNuke": 60 }, "Rationale": "India is on the verge of cultural victory (influential over 5/6 civs, Denmark falls in 1 turn). Must emergency pivot to Science victory race while preparing for inevitable Indian war. Maximizing science output and espionage to steal India's advanced techs (they are in Atomic era). Maintaining strong defense as India has 4742 military strength and will likely attack. Reducing offensive operations to focus on survival and space race." } },
               { "tool": "set-relationship", "arguments": { "TargetID": 7, "Public": -100, "Private": -100, "Rationale": "India is the existential threat with 2580 score, 1012 tourism/turn, and about to achieve cultural victory. They already have 160% influence over us. Must maintain maximum hostility to close borders (reducing their tourism), cut trade, and prepare for war. They have twice our military strength (4742 vs 2405) and atomic tech, but we cannot allow open borders to continue feeding their cultural dominance." } }
             ]
             ```
            
             Wait, I need to check if I should also adjust the relationship with The Shoshone since peace was just made. If I don't set it, they might redeclare war while I'm fighting India.
            
             Let me add:
             - set-relationship with Shoshone (Opponent 5): Set to neutral/positive to keep peace
            
             Actually, looking at the Shoshone data, they have public 80, private 90 opinion of us, so they like us but we're at war. Peace was accepted, so relationship should normalize. I should set it to positive to ensure peace holds.
            
             But I can only call tools that are needed. The Shoshone peace is already accepted, so maybe the system will update it automatically.
            
             Let me check if there are any other critical relationships. Egypt is at war with us and is weak (MS 1026). We could potentially take their capital for domination victory, but that doesn't stop India from winning culturally.
            
             Actually, if India wins culturally, the game ends. So I must focus on stopping India or winning faster.
            
             Science victory requires: Advanced Ballistics, Particle Physics, Nanotechnology, Steam Power, Robotics, etc. We're in Modern era researching Plastics. India is in Atomic era.
            
             I need to rush.
            
             Final check on tools:
             - set-flavors: REQUIRED (must change or keep status quo)
             - set-research: Optional, Replaceable Parts is already set which is fine
             - set-policy: Optional, Free Thought is already set which is good
             - set-relationship: Optional
            
             I'll do set-flavors (required) and set-relationship with India (critical).
            
             Actually, looking at the rules, I MUST call either set-flavors or keep-status-quo. Since I'm changing strategy, I call set-flavors.
            
             The relationship with India is already -100/-100, so calling set-relationship might be redundant, but it ensures the staff members know I want to maintain this hostility.
            
             Let me also consider calling set-research to change from Replaceable Parts to something else. But Replaceable Parts gives Artillery which I need for defense. So keep it.
            
             Policy: Free Thought is good for science, keep it.
            
             So my final answer is the two tools above.
            
             Wait, I should check the Shoshone ID. Opponent 5 is The Shoshone. Opponent 7 is India.
            
             Yes.
            
             One more thing: I should consider setting the Shoshone relationship to positive to ensure they don't attack while I face India. But they just made peace, and denounced us, so maybe wait.
            
             Actually, looking at the war weariness, Shoshone has 31% and we have 33%, so both sides are tired. Setting relationship to positive would help cement peace.
            
             But India is the priority. I'll add a third call for Shoshone relationship.
            
             ```json
             [
               { "tool": "set-flavors", "arguments": { "GrandStrategy": "Spaceship", "Flavors": { "Science": 100, "Espionage": 100, "Production": 90, "Defense": 90, "CityDefense": 90, "Growth": 80, "Happiness": 70, "Infrastructure": 70, "Gold": 60, "Mobilization": 70, "MilitaryTraining": 60, "Offense": 30, "Nuke": 70, "UseNuke": 60, "Diplomacy": 40 }, "Rationale": "India is one turn away from cultural dominance over all civs (Denmark at 98%, becomes influential in 1 turn). Emergency pivot to Science victory race. Must maximize science output (100), espionage to steal atomic tech from India (100), and maintain defensive military (90) against inevitable Indian attack (4742 MS vs our 2405). Reducing offensive operations to focus on survival and spaceship construction. Need diplomats for city-state alliances as backup plan." } },
               { "tool": "set-relationship", "arguments": { "TargetID": 7, "Public": -100, "Private": -100, "Rationale": "India is the existential threat: 2580 score, Atomic era, 1012 tourism/turn, 5/6 civs culturally influenced, about to win in 1 turn when Denmark falls. They already dominate us culturally (160%). Maintaining maximum hostility to ensure closed borders, cut tourism flows, and prepare for total war. They have double our military strength and nuclear capability imminent." } },
               { "tool": "set-relationship", "arguments": { "TargetID": 5, "Public": 50, "Private": 50, "Rationale": "Peace was just accepted with The Shoshone (turn 334). Both sides have high war weariness (31% and 33%). Set positive relations to cement peace treaty and prevent two-front war while facing the greater Indian threat. They share Freedom ideology and have favorable opinion of us (public 80, private 90)." } }
             ]
             ```
            
             This looks good. I prioritized the existential threat (India) while securing the flank (Shoshone) and pivoting strategy to Science.
