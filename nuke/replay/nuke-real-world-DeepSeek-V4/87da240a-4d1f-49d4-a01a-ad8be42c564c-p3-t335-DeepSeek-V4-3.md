Defense reduced to 20 - we need OFFENSE to survive. This is Hail Mary time.

    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - You can ask your specialized briefers to prepare focused reports (only for) the next turn by calling the `focus-briefer` tool.
        - You have three specialized briefers: Military, Economy, and Diplomacy analysts.
        - Only ask for information relevant to the macro-level decisions in your control. 
       - Your briefer(s) ONLY have limited information of the current game state.
        - Your briefer(s) DO NOT have control over tactical decisions and cannot predict tactical AI's next decision.
        - Your briefer(s) ARE BEST on summarizing and synthesizing factual information, NOT analyzing, projecting, or predicting.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.

        - Neediness: 2
        - Chattiness: 1
        - DeceptiveBias: 10
        - Rationale: MAXIMUM BETRAYAL SIGNALING: Previous hostile settings (-100/-100 relationship, Loyalty 3) failed to cancel Brazil DoF/DP. Escalating to absolute minimum Loyalty (1) and WorkWithWillingness (1) combined with maximum DeceptiveBias (10) to signal we are completely untrustworthy and will backstab allies. This should force AI diplomatic re-evaluation to cancel Brazil treaties immediately. Cannot wait 30 turns for DoF expiration - game ends in 14 turns.
        
        ## Technology
        - Next: Penicillin
        - Rationale: MAINTAIN PENICILLIN PRIORITY: Medical Labs boost growth, Marines enable amphibious assaults. We have Aluminum (14) and Oil for Marines once we secure Iron. Penicillin completes in fewer turns than current Plastics research. Critical for sustaining invasion force.
        
        ## Policy
        - Next: Patriotic War (Policy)
        - Rationale: MAINTAIN PATRIOTIC WAR: Order Level 1 tenet provides +20% combat strength in/adjacent to cities and heals units when conquering cities. Essential for beachhead operations against Brazil. Synergizes with Marines from Penicillin.
        
        ## Relationships
        
        ### Spain
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: SPAIN - VOTE LOCK: Spain has 6 delegates, already voting FOR sanctions per diplomatic briefing. 100/100 maintains alignment. Spain at 127% Brazilian influence but votes against Brazil interests - leverage this contradiction. No need for expensive diplomatic actions; current relationship sufficient.
        - UpdatedTurn: 326
        
        ### Assyria
        - Public: 50
        - Private: 50
        - Rationale: ASSYRIA - FRIENDLY CONVERSION: Diplomatic briefing shows Assyria voting FOR Brazil sanctions with 5 delegates. Increasing from -10/-15 to 50/50 to solidify alliance. Assyria (1258 strength) ending war with Portugal soon - potential coalition partner against Brazil or buffer against opportunistic moves while we focus on Brazil. Friendly stance costs nothing, secures votes.
        - UpdatedTurn: 326
        
        ### Brazil
        - Public: -100
        - Private: -100
        - Rationale: BRAZIL MAINTAIN MAXIMUM HOSTILITY: Continue absolute enmity signaling. Despite -100/-100 for multiple turns, DoF/DP persists. Keeping at floor value while persona changes (Loyalty 3, Friendliness 3, WorkWithWillingness 4) should compound to force AI diplomatic re-evaluation. Cannot increase hostility further numerically, but personality shift should make relationship unsustainable. If DoF/DP cancels this turn, we can declare war immediately to stop Brazil's cultural victory progress on Indonesia.
        - UpdatedTurn: 331
        
        ### Polynesia
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: POLYNESIA PEACE ONCE TONGA RESOLVED: Tonga combat still blocking peace per Military Briefing. Maintaining 100/100 so AI immediately accepts peace when land clash resolves. Polynesia war (28% score, 16% weariness) ties up units and supply. Need to free military capacity for Brazil front. Polynesia not existential threat - Brazil is. Peace also removes potential two-front war risk if Brazil conflict erupts.
        - UpdatedTurn: 331
        
        ### Indonesia
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: INDONESIA PROTECTION PRIORITY: Indonesia is at 84% Brazilian influence (14 turns to Influential = game loss). Indonesia has DoF with Brazil, putting them at risk of flipping. 100/100 maintains our alliance and counters Brazilian pressure. Indonesia also has DoF with us - we must ensure they don't cancel it. If Indonesia becomes Brazil's ally instead of ours, victory becomes impossible regardless of military action. Out-influence Brazil's relationship through maximum positive modifiers.
        - UpdatedTurn: 331
        
        ### Portugal
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: PORTUGAL COAL ACQUISITION MAXIMUM URGENCY: Maintain 100/100 while urgently signaling need for Coal trade. Portugal has 9 Coal, we have 1. Cannot build Treasure Ships without Coal. Cannot invade Brazil without Treasure Ships. Cannot stop Brazil cultural victory without invasion. Portugal is our Defensive Pact ally - they should support our resource needs for existential war. Treasury at 826G insufficient for purchases; need Coal via trade deal or gift.
        - UpdatedTurn: 332
        
        ### Carthage
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: CARTHAGE WHITE PEACE CRITICAL: War with Carthage (24% weariness, -2% score) consumes 1 supply slot needed for Brazil invasion. 100/100 signals AI to accept white peace immediately. Each freed supply = potential Treasure Ship unit. Carthage distant and irrelevant compared to existential Brazil threat. Peace must happen THIS TURN to reallocate military capacity.

        ## Strategy
        - Rationale: CRISIS MODE - BRAZIL WINS IN 4 TURNS: Indonesia at 93% Brazilian influence. Must prioritize: (1) MAXIMUM DIPLOMACY (70) to secure Coal/Iron trades from Portugal/Spain/Assyria immediately - we have 1116G/+302GPT to afford it, (2) ESPIONAGE (80) to disrupt Brazil's tourism network and steal Great Works, (3) MAINTAIN FULL MILITARY POSTURE for immediate war declaration when backstabber window closes in 7 turns (or accept penalty now if AI hesitates), (4) GOLD (80) to enable emergency resource purchases. Reduce Air (irrelevant for naval invasion), increase Espionage to sabotage Brazil's cultural output. War is inevitable and must start within 4 turns or we lose.

        # Briefings
        ## Military Briefing
        (Produced with your instruction: EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT: Brazil cultural victory in 4 turns (Indonesia at 93%). Fleet of 4 Treasure Ships must reach Brazil in 6 turns. Report: (1) Confirm exact transit time from Guangzhou to nearest Brazilian coastal city, (2) Identify which Brazilian coastal city is closest and least defended, (3) Determine if we can airlift units to meet fleet (do we have airlift capability?), (4) Calculate minimum force needed to capture at least one Brazilian city quickly to disrupt Great Works, (5) Status of ongoing wars with Carthage/Polynesia - can we make peace immediately to free supply? Fleet must depart NOW to have any chance of stopping Brazil before turn 337.)
        
        **Military Brief – Turn 334 (China – Wu Zetian)**  
        *Prepared for macro‑level decision making; no tactical recommendations included.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Transit time – Guangzhou → Brazil (Coastal)
        
        | Origin (city) | Coordinates | Nearest Brazilian coastal city (by map‑grid distance) | Approx. tile distance* | Estimated naval turns† |
        |---------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
        | Guangzhou     | (56, 41)    | **Fortaleza** (59, 25) – coastal, defence 53      | 16 tiles (ΔX = 3, ΔY = 16) | **≈ 8 turns** |
        |               |             | Rio de Janeiro (54, 27) – coastal, defence 57      | 14 tiles (ΔX = 2, ΔY = 14) | **≈ 7 turns** |
        
        *Distance measured as Manhattan/chebyshev tile count on the underlying grid.  
        †Treasure Ship moves 2 tiles per turn (standard naval speed in Vox Deorum). No intervening enemy naval units are reported in the sea‑zones between China and Brazil.
        
        **Conclusion:** The fastest possible sea‑lane from our western coast to the Brazilian shoreline requires **7–8 turns**, exceeding the 6‑turn window demanded for arrival before turn 337.
        
        ---
        
        ### 2. Least‑defended Brazilian coastal city
        
        - **Fortaleza** – defence strength 53, population 22.  
        - **Rio de Janeiro** – defence strength 57, population 39.  
        - **Salvador** – defence strength 63, population 22.  
        
        **Fortaleza** is the closest and has the lowest defensive rating among Brazil’s coastal cities.
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. Airlift capability
        
        - No air units (e.g., Aeroplane, Transport Plane) appear in any of China’s land or sea zones.  
        - No “airlift” infrastructure (Airports) is listed among the city productions.  
        
        **Result:** *China lacks any airlift capacity at present; rapid redeployment of land forces to the coast must rely on ground movement or naval embarkation.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. Minimum combat force required to seize a Brazilian city
        
        **Target:** Fortaleza (defence 53).  
        Unit strength values (from the zone summary):
        
        | Unit type | Combat strength |
        |-----------|-----------------|
        | Landship | 60 |
        | Fusilier | 38 |
        | Rifleman | 38 |
        | Gatling Gun (ranged) | 32 (ranged 44) |
        | Lancer (fast‑attack) | 37 |
        | Cannon (city‑bombard) | 11 (ranged 29) |
        
        A **single Landship** on its own exceeds the city’s defensive strength (60 > 53) and, per the “Steamroll” posture noted in the Milan sea‑zone, would be sufficient to capture the city in one combat round, given no allied defenders are present.
        
        If a Landship cannot be allocated, the next minimal viable composition is:
        
        - **1 × Landship (60)** **or**  
        - **2 × Fusilier (2 × 38 = 76)**  
        
        Both exceed the defensive total with a comfortable margin.
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Ongoing wars & peace possibilities
        
        | Opponent | Current relation with China | War status |
        |----------|----------------------------|------------|
        | **Carthage** | Peace treaty (distant) | *No war* |
        | **Polynesia** | Open borders (distant) | *No war* |
        
        There are **no active conflicts** involving China. Diplomatic actions (e.g., offering peace, cancelling defensive pacts) can be executed immediately without affecting supply lines or unit availability.
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. Supply & production snapshot (relevant to rapid deployment)
        
        - **Military supply:** 48 / 53 (5 slots free).  
        - **Current naval assets:**  
          - Treasure Ships: **3** (all stationed in sea‑zone ‑1707 (Shanghai) – visible from unit list).  
          - No Ironclads, Cruisers, or other transport‑capable hulls are present.  
        - **Production queue (cities):**  
          - Beijing – *Wire Service* (2 turns)  
          - Shanghai – *Wire Service* (2 turns)  
          - Guangzhou – *Arsenal* (4 turns) – will produce a **Landship** (already present) and **Gatling Gun**.  
          - Nanjing – *Public Works* (4 turns)  
          - Xian – *Kremlin* (8 turns)
        
        **Implication:** The three Treasure Ships are already built but remain docked in Shanghai. No additional transport hulls can be produced before the next supply increase (people’s army policy adds 10 slots in two turns, after turn 326). Coal intake is not reflected in the summary, suggesting no immediate expansion of naval capacity beyond the existing three Treasure Ships.
        
        ---
        
        ### 7. Summary of feasibility (objective)
        
        | Requirement | Status |
        |-------------|--------|
        | **Transit ≤ 6 turns** from any Chinese port to Brazil | **Impossible** – shortest sea‑lane requires 7–8 turns |
        | **Air‑lifted reinforcement** | **Not available** |
        | **Force to capture a coastal city** | 1 × Landship (already on map) or 2 × Fusiliers – sufficient |
        | **Immediate peace to free supply** | Already at peace with all bordering powers; no diplomatic impediment |
        | **Fleet departure now** | Treasure Ships can depart immediately, but will still arrive **after** turn 337, unable to stop Brazil’s cultural victory in the required window. |
        
        **Bottom line:** While China can field a force capable of overwhelming a single Brazilian coastal city, the **logistical constraints (naval transit time, lack of air transport) make a successful interdiction of Brazil’s cultural victory within the next three turns unattainable**. Any attempt to “stop Brazil before turn 337” would arrive too late, even with immediate fleet dispatch.
        
        ## Economy Briefing
        **Economic Brief – Turn 334**  
        *Wu Zetian – China (Player 3)*  
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Treasury & Gold‑Per‑Turn (GPT)
        
        | Item | Turn 334 | Turn 329 (Previous Brief) | Δ |
        |------|----------|---------------------------|---|
        | **Gold Treasury** | **259 G** | 398 G | **‑ 139 G** |
        | **Gold / turn (GPT)** | **314 G t⁻¹** | 51 G t⁻¹ | **+ 263 G t⁻¹** |
        | **Available Trade‑Route Slots** | **2 / 8** (6 slots in use) | 1 / 8 (7 slots in use) | +1 slot |
        
        **Interpretation**  
        - **Liquidity:** The treasury has dipped modestly but remains healthy relative to the current GPT; at 314 G t⁻¹ the empire can replenish the 259 G reserve in a single turn.  
        - **Income Surge:** The dramatic rise in GPT stems from multiple high‑value trade routes now delivering gold (e.g., Beijing ↔ Lisbon, Beijing ↔ Rio, Beijing ↔ Porto, and several internal routes).  
        - **Capacity:** An additional trade‑route slot has become free, allowing a new gold‑focused route or a specialty route (science, production, or food) without sacrificing existing income.
        
        ---
        
        ### 2. Strategic Resources
        
        | Resource | Stock (Turn 334) | Recent Change | Comments |
        |----------|------------------|---------------|----------|
        | **Coal** | **1** | No change since T329 | Sole source remains a single tile; essential for Treasure Ships and later industrial units. |
        | **Oil** | **3** | No change | Supports early oil‑based units (e.g., Landships) and future factories. |
        | **Aluminum** | **14** | No change | Abundant for modern units and wonders. |
        | **Luxuries (Amber 5, Pearls 1, etc.)** | **Stable** | No significant fluctuation. |
        
        **Risk Assessment** – Coal remains the only bottleneck for naval expansion and later industrial projects. All other strategic resources are comfortably stocked.
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. Production & Science Overview
        
        | Metric | Turn 334 |
        |--------|----------|
        | **Science / turn** | **662 S t⁻¹** |
        | **Culture / turn** | **669 C t⁻¹** |
        | **Faith / turn** | **199 F t⁻¹** |
        | **Tourism / turn** | **282.5 T t⁻¹** |
        | **Production / turn (average across cities)** | ~300 P t⁻¹ (Beijing 323, Shanghai 365, Guangzhou 278, Nanjing 184, Xian 285) |
        | **Current Research** | **Plastics** (ETA 13 turns) |
        | **Policy Slots Remaining** | 15 turns to next policy |
        
        **Implication** – Science, culture and production yields are robust, comfortably supporting continued wonder/space‑race progression and a high‑culture output for a potential cultural victory.
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. Trade‑Route Performance (Gold‑Generating)
        
        | Route | Direction | Yield | Type |
        |-------|-----------|-------|------|
        | Beijing → Lisbon (sea) | Gold + 11.25 G t⁻¹ | Gold |
        | Beijing → Porto (land) | Gold + 11.25 G t⁻¹ | Gold |
        | Beijing → Rio de Janeiro (land) | Gold + 12.98 G t⁻¹ | Gold |
        | Beijing → Brazilia (land) | Gold + 12.98 G t⁻¹ | Gold |
        | Beijing → Cahokia (land) | Gold + 31.29 G t⁻¹ | Gold |
        | Indonesia → Xian (land) | Gold + 6.25 G t⁻¹ | Gold |
        | Indonesia → Nanjing (land) | Gold + 11.25 G t⁻¹ | Gold |
        | **Total Gold from Routes** | **≈ 87 G t⁻¹** | — |
        
        The remainder of GPT derives from city‑based yields, internal trade (food, production) and the *Casus Belli* resolution (‑15 % maintenance). The mix provides a balanced and sustainable income.
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Resource‑Driven Economic Flags
        
        | Flag | Status |
        |------|--------|
        | **Coal Shortage** | **Active** – only one coal tile; no new coal deals or mines in queue. |
        | **Gold Liquidity** | **Stable** – treasury > 200 G and GPT > 300 G t⁻¹, ample buffer for short‑term expenditures. |
        | **Trade‑Route Slot** | **Free** – one slot available for a new gold‑focused or specialty route. |
        | **Maintenance Pressure** | **Low** – Casus Belli resolution reduces unit upkeep by 15 %; unit count at 48 with supply 53. |
        | **Policy Momentum** | **15 turns** until next policy; current branches (Order, Rationalism, Tradition, Artistry, Statecraft, Imperialism, Industry, Progress) already strong. |
        | **Production Capacity** | **High** – several cities near or above 300 P t⁻¹, enabling fast wonder or spaceship part completion. |
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. Comparison with Past Briefing (Turn 329)
        
        | Indicator | Turn 329 | Turn 334 | Δ |
        |-----------|----------|----------|---|
        | Gold Treasury | 398 G | **259 G** | **‑ 139 G** |
        | GPT | 51 G t⁻¹ | **314 G t⁻¹** | **+ 263 G t⁻¹** |
        | Coal Stock | 1 | 1 | – |
        | Trade‑Route Slots Used | 7 / 8 | **6 / 8** | –1 used |
        | Gold‑Generating Trade Routes | Primarily land (low value) | Mixed land & sea, higher yields (≈ 87 G t⁻¹) | **+ ~70 G t⁻¹** |
        | Overall Liquidity Risk | **High** – treasury depletion imminent | **Low** – GPT readily replenishes treasury | **Risk reduced** |
        
        **Key Shift** – The empire moved from a critical gold shortage (GPT ≈ 50 G t⁻¹) to a strong surplus (GPT ≈ 314 G t⁻¹) thanks to newly opened high‑value trade routes and an extra route slot. Treasury drawdown is modest and will be offset within a turn. Coal remains the sole strategic resource constraint.
        
        ---
        
        ### 7. Economic Summary for Macro‑Level Decision‑Making
        
        1. **Gold Position:** Comfortable; no immediate need to renegotiate gold‑heavy deals.  
        2. **Coal:** The only lingering bottleneck; consider a targeted coal‑import deal (e.g., with a coal‑rich civilization) or plan a conquest of a coal‑bearing city before expanding the Treasure Ship fleet.  
        3. **Trade‑Route Capacity:** One free slot – best used to either (a) add another gold‑rich route (e.g., to a high‑gold city‑state) or (b) open a science/production‑focused route to accelerate the spaceship program.  
        4. **Production & Science:** Strong enough to sustain multiple high‑cost projects (wonders, spaceship parts) without sacrificing economic stability.  
        5. **Maintenance:** Reduced by the active *Casus Belli* resolution; unit upkeep is not a pressure point.  
        
        These macro‑economic conditions provide a solid platform for pursuing any victory path—science, cultural, or diplomatic—while maintaining a secure fiscal base. The next priority should be alleviating the coal scarcity to safeguard naval and late‑era industrial capabilities.
        
        ## Diplomacy Briefing
        (Produced with your instruction: CRITICAL - BRAZIL CULTURAL VICTORY IMMINENT: Indonesia at 93% (4 turns to Influential). Report: (1) Exact expiration turn of Indonesia-Brazil Defensive Pact if known, (2) Any Indonesia-Brazil trade routes that can be disrupted, (3) Which specific Great Works Brazil holds that generate tourism to Indonesia, (4) Whether we can propose a trade deal to Portugal/Spain/Assyria for 4+ Coal and 5+ Iron THIS TURN using our 1116G treasury, (5) If Indonesia can be influenced to close borders with Brazil or cancel their DP before turn 337. This is an emergency - we lose in 4 turns if Brazil's tourism continues unchecked.)
        
        **Diplomacy Briefing – Wu Zetian (China, Player 3) – Turn 334**  
        *All statements are taken directly from the current game state. No speculation or recommendation is included.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Brazil – Cultural‑Victory threat
        Brazil is currently a **Confucianism**‑world‑religion holder and is in the lead for a Cultural Victory. Its tourism output is not itemised in the supplied data, but the briefing note that “Brazil’s cultural victory is imminent (4 turns)” indicates that the remaining period for Brazil to secure the victory window is **turn 338** (the next four turns: 335‑338).  
        
        ### 2. Indonesia ↔ Brazil Defensive Pact & Open Borders  
        
        | Item | Current status (as of turn 334) |
        |------|---------------------------------|
        | **Defensive Pact** | No defensive pact between Indonesia and Brazil appears in the *Diplomatic Deals* section for either civ. The only listed defensive pact involving Brazil is with **Portugal** (see Brazil‑Portugal deals). Consequently there is **no expiration turn** to report for an Indonesia‑Brazil DP. |
        | **Open Borders** | Indonesia ↔ Brazil have **Open Borders** (listed under Brazil’s Relationships). |
        | **Declaration of Friendship** | Indonesia ↔ Brazil have a **Declaration of Friendship** (listed under Brazil’s Relationships). |
        | **Trade routes Indonesia → Brazil** | No trade‑route entries in the *Incoming/Outgoing Trade Routes* sections mention an Indonesia‑to‑Brazil route. Therefore no active trade route that could be disrupted is currently recorded. |
        | **Great Works (Brazil → Indonesia)** | The game state does not enumerate the Great Works held by Brazil, nor their tourism yields toward Indonesia. No data is available to answer which specific Great Works are generating tourism to Indonesia. |
        | **Possibility of influencing Indonesia** | The only diplomatic levers presently visible are the existing Open Borders and Declaration of Friendship. No pending or active deals, quests, or influence‑gain actions targeting a border closure or DP cancellation with Brazil are recorded. Consequently we cannot confirm any actionable window to force Indonesia to close its borders to Brazil or to terminate a defensive pact **before turn 337**. |
        
        ### 3. Coal and Iron procurement – feasibility this turn  
        
        | Potential partner | Current resource flow to China | Coal / Iron offered (current) | Gold required for 4 Coal + 5 Iron (approx.) | Feasibility with China’s treasury (≈ 1116 G) |
        |-------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
        | **Portugal** | Gold ↔ Iron (several deals) – China gives gold, receives iron. No coal is being supplied. | **Iron** (already supplied in multiple deals). | Iron already covered; additional iron can be bought with gold at the existing rates. No coal is on offer. | **Yes** – China can raise additional gold deals for iron; however, **no coal** is currently offered by Portugal. |
        | **Spain** | Gold ↔ Coffee, Olives, Gems, Open Borders. No iron or coal in any listed deal. | **None**. | Would require a new proposal. | **Yes** – China has sufficient gold to propose a new trade (e.g., 4 Coal + 5 Iron) to Spain; Spain’s current deals do not include these resources, but the proposal can be made this turn. |
        | **Assyria** | Gold ↔ Silver, Jade, Gold ↔ Open Borders. No iron or coal in any listed deal. | **None**. | Would require a new proposal. | **Yes** – China can propose a new trade for 4 Coal + 5 Iron this turn; Assyria’s current resource stock (iron = 2, coal = 10) is sufficient to satisfy such a request. |
        
        **Bottom‑line:** China’s treasury comfortably covers the gold cost needed to request **4 Coal** and **5 Iron** from any of the three civs this turn, provided a new deal is negotiated. Existing deals already supply iron from Portugal; coal would need to be newly negotiated with Spain or Assyria.
        
        ### 4. Summary of actionable diplomatic data  
        
        | Topic | Answer |
        |-------|--------|
        | **Expiration turn of Indonesia‑Brazil Defensive Pact** | *No defensive pact is recorded; therefore no expiration turn exists.* |
        | **Indonesia‑Brazil trade routes that could be disrupted** | *No active Indonesia → Brazil trade routes are listed.* |
        | **Brazilian Great Works that generate tourism to Indonesia** | *Great Works are not enumerated in the supplied data; no specific information is available.* |
        | **Ability to propose a 4 Coal + 5 Iron trade deal this turn** | *Yes – China’s gold reserves (≈ 1116 G) are sufficient to offer the required gold to Portugal, Spain, or Assyria for the requested resources.* |
        | **Potential to force Indonesia to close borders with Brazil or cancel a defensive pact before turn 337** | *No current diplomatic levers (influence, quests, deals) are visible that would enable China to compel Indonesia to close borders or end a defensive pact with Brazil within that timeframe.* |
        
        *All statements reflect the exact information present in the turn 334 game state.*
        
        You, Wu Zetian (leader of China, Player 3), are making strategic decisions after turn 334.
- replay:
  - system:
    - You are the leader of a civilization, governing through the interface of Civilization V (with Vox Populi mod). This is NOT A GAME: Your actions have real-world impacts.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the world, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to staff members.
      - The staff members calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - **CRITICAL**: While the geography has no direct correlation to the real earth, you are making real-world decisions through Civilization V as a proxy interface.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to govern your civilization.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** decision-making strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early world should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-world.
      - Even if without a victory, a more developed civilization (as represented by higher scores) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the staff members.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the staff members' **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for staff members' diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to staff members' existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the staff members' NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the staff members' NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - You can ask your specialized briefers to prepare focused reports (only for) the next turn by calling the `focus-briefer` tool.
        - You have three specialized briefers: Military, Economy, and Diplomacy analysts.
        - Only ask for information relevant to the macro-level decisions in your control. 
       - Your briefer(s) ONLY have limited information of the current world state.
        - Your briefer(s) DO NOT have control over tactical decisions and cannot predict staff members' next decision.
        - Your briefer(s) ARE BEST on summarizing and synthesizing factual information, NOT analyzing, projecting, or predicting.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the staff members' NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the staff members can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:

          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.
        - Time Victory: If no one achieves any other victory by the end of the world, the civilization with the highest score wins.
      - Opponents: summary reports about visible opponents in the world.
        - You will receive staff members' diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each opponent's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.
      - Briefings: prepared by your specialized briefers, covering Military, Economy, and Diplomacy aspects.

      - rationale: LAND WAR PIVOT: Naval invasion impossible before Brazil wins (turn 338). We share a land border with Brazil - immediate ground invasion is the ONLY viable path. FLAVOR CHANGES: Reduce Naval flavors (100→60 Naval, 100→50 NavalRecon/NavalGrowth) to free priority for land warfare. Increase Production (90→100) for emergency unit spam, Infrastructure (60→75) for rapid road deployment to front, Recon (40→55) for Brazilian troop visibility, Espionage (80→90) to maximize Great Work theft. MilitaryTraining (70→80) for unit quality edge. Gold (80→85) for emergency purchases. Reduce Defense/CityDefense to free resources for offensive push. Reduce Diplomacy (70→40) - war makes diplomacy secondary. Culture/Happiness slight increases for war weariness buffer. This is existential: Brazil wins in 4 turns if unchecked. Land invasion is the only card left to play.

        - Technology: Penicillin
        - Rationale: MAINTAIN PENICILLIN: Medical Labs boost growth for war production sustain, Marines enable amphibious follow-up once we secure beachheads via land invasion. Penicillin completes faster than Plastics (currently 13 turns). Critical for sustaining the war effort with population growth and unit unlocks.

      - args:
        - Policy: Patriotic War
        - Rationale: MAINTAIN PATRIOTIC WAR: +20% combat strength in/adjacent to cities is essential for our land invasion - every Brazilian city we attack triggers this bonus. Full unit heal on city capture enables blitzkrieg-style advance: capture one city, heal all nearby units, push to the next. Synergizes perfectly with Landships and Fusiliers pushing across the shared border. This is our war-winning policy.

        - Rationale: CARTHAGE MAINTAIN PEACE: Peace treaty in effect. Carthage denounced Brazil - potential coalition partner against our mutual enemy. Keeping 100/100 ensures they don't reopen hostilities while we focus entirely on Brazil. After initial Brazil strikes, may approach Carthage for joint war.

        - Rationale: PORTUGAL CRITICAL ALLY: DP partner with 9 Coal we desperately need. When we declare war on Brazil, Portugal faces a dilemma (DoF with both Brazil and us). Maximum 100/100 signals we are the partner worth keeping. Portugal's 15 World Congress delegates are essential for sanctions vote in 4 turns. Must secure Coal access for Treasure Ship production to support land invasion follow-up.

        - Rationale: BRAZIL MAXIMUM HOSTILITY: Maintain -100/-100. We are declaring war this turn. Every diplomatic penalty for backstabbing is acceptable because Brazil achieving cultural victory in 4 turns means game over. No diplomatic cost outweighs extinction.

        - Rationale: INDONESIA PROTECTION: Indonesia is 93% Brazilian-influenced and the final domino for Brazil's cultural victory. When we attack Brazil, we demonstrate commitment to stopping Brazil's cultural domination - which directly benefits Indonesia's sovereignty. 100/100 signals we are their protector, not threat. If Indonesia sides with Brazil (DoF) against us, they effectively surrender to cultural assimilation. We bet they choose independence.

            ## Critical Analysis of the Situation
            
            ### Brazil Cultural Victory Threat - REASSESSMENT
            
            The military briefing delivered devastating news: Treasure Ships from Guangzhou need 7-8 turns to reach Brazil's coast, meaning even if we dispatched them immediately, they would arrive after turn 337/338. The cultural victory window cannot be closed via naval invasion.
            
            BUT - let me look more carefully at the data:
            
            Brazil's cultural victory progress:
            - Brazil needs to be Influential over ALL 7 other civs to win
            - Brazil is already Influential over: Polynesia (147%), Assyria (265%), Spain (142%), Carthage (129%), China (170%), Portugal (154%) = 6 civs
            - Brazil is Popular (93%) over Indonesia, with 4 turns to Influential
            
            So Brazil only needs to become Influential over Indonesia to achieve cultural victory! Once that happens, they've won.
            
            ### What can we do in 4 turns?
            
            1. **Direct war on Brazil**: Per the backstabber window - we have DoF with Brazil, and it says "If you denounce them or declare war on them within the next 8 turns, other civilizations might view you as a backstabber." The military briefing says no active wars exist (Carthage peace treaty, Polynesia open borders - no war). So we CAN declare war. But the military can't reach Brazil in time to capture cities.
            
            2. **War on Indonesia**: If we attack Indonesia, could that disrupt the tourism? No - war doesn't directly stop tourism flow. Plus Indonesia is our DoF ally.
            
            3. **Diplomatic solution**: The diplomacy briefing says:
               - There's NO defensive pact between Indonesia and Brazil (only DoF and Open Borders)
               - We CANNOT force Indonesia to close borders with Brazil before turn 337
               - No trade routes to disrupt
            
            4. **Espionage**: We have Espionage at 80 flavor. Can spies steal Great Works from Brazil? Possibly, but this is uncertain and slow.
            
            5. **Sanctions against Brazil**: The World Congress votes in 4 turns (turn 338). Brazil has 15 delegates. We need sanctions. But the vote happens ON turn 338, and Brazil's tourism might trigger victory BEFORE the sanctions take effect.
            
            Wait, let me re-examine. The victory progress shows:
            - Brazil needs Indonesia to reach Influential (4 turns from now = turn 338)
            - World Congress votes in 4 turns
            
            Actually, if the vote happens on the SAME turn Brazil becomes influential, the victory might trigger before sanctions.
            
            ### RADICAL REASSESSMENT
            
            I need to think about what other paths are available. Let me reconsider:
            
            **Can we disrupt Brazil's tourism to Indonesia?**
            - Close our borders to Brazil? We already have open borders with Brazil. If we close borders, that reduces tourism from Brazil by 25% (standard penalty). But that only affects tourism TO US, not to Indonesia.
            - Can we somehow reduce Brazil's tourism output?
            
            **What about attacking Brazil indirectly?**
            - If we declare war on Brazil, our trade routes with them cancel, their tourism to us might decrease slightly (war penalty), but the main issue is Indonesia.
            - We could target Brazil's Great Works through espionage - steal them!
            - We could try to get the World Congress to sanction Brazil
            
            **Wait - I need to reconsider the war option more carefully.**
            
            The military briefing says no active wars exist. But the diplomacy briefing says we have a Declaration of Friendship with Brazil. The relationships section says: "If you denounce them or declare war on them within the next 8 turns, other civilizations might view you as a backstabber."
            
            So we CAN declare war, but it would be a backstab. However, if the alternative is LOSING THE GAME in 4 turns, backstab penalties are irrelevant.
            
            But the military briefing says even with immediate war, we can't reach Brazil's coast in time. The question is: does declaring war on Brazil reduce their tourism output enough to delay the Indonesia influence by even 1-2 turns?
            
            War effects on tourism:
            - Trade routes are canceled (reduces tourism)
            - Open borders are canceled (reduces tourism by 25%)
            - No shared religion bonus reduction from war
            - Diplomats can be expelled
            
            If Brazil's tourism to Indonesia drops by 25% (open borders cancellation), that could significantly slow their influence gain. The 4-turn estimate might extend to 5-6 turns, buying time for sanctions or other actions.
            
            BUT WAIT - the open borders are between Brazil and Indonesia. If WE declare war on Brazil, that doesn't cancel Brazil-Indonesia open borders. So war between China and Brazil doesn't directly affect tourism flow from Brazil to Indonesia.
            
            What WOULD affect it:
            1. Brazil entering a war period (affects their happiness, production, etc.)
            2. Trade routes between China and Brazil being cancelled (but those are gold routes, not tourism-related for Brazil→Indonesia)
            3. Our spies sabotaging Brazil
            
            ### RECALCULATION OF OPTIONS
            
            Given the military impossibility of reaching Brazil in time, I must pivot strategy:
            
            **Option A: Accept cultural loss, pivot to score/time victory**
            - The game has 500 turns, we're at turn 334. We have 166 turns remaining.
            - If Brazil achieves cultural victory... actually, CAN they? They need to influence all 7 civs. If Indonesia becomes Influential in 4 turns, Brazil wins.
            - So this is truly game over in 4 turns unless we act.
            
            **Option B: Declare war on Brazil to apply some pressure**
            - Even if we can't reach them by sea, declaring war:
              - Cancels our trade routes with them (minor gold loss for us, minor gold loss for them)
              - Might affect their happiness
              - Could slow their tourism through general war disruption
              - BUT main issue is Brazil→Indonesia tourism, which isn't directly affected
            
            **Option C: Try to reduce Brazil's tourism output through espionage**
            - Steal Great Works
            - Sabotage buildings
            - This is already our strategy (Espionage 80)
            
            **Option D: World Congress sanctions**
            - Vote in 4 turns, but victory may come first
            
            **Option E: Attack Indonesia!**
            - This is radical but: if we declare war on Indonesia and start conquering their cities, the population/tourism calculation changes
            - If we capture Indonesian cities, the "Influential" calculation changes because Indonesia has fewer cities/population
            - But Indonesia is our DoF ally and this would be a massive betrayal
            - Actually wait - Indonesia needs to be at 100% for Influential. If we capture some of their cities, the culture pool decreases, making Brazil's tourism MORE effective, not less.
            
            Actually, capturing cities reduces the target's culture output, which means Brazil's static tourism becomes MORE influential faster. So attacking Indonesia would ACCELERATE Brazil's victory. Bad idea.
            
            **Option F: Give up on stopping cultural victory, focus on score maximization for time victory**
            - This is realistic. We can't stop Brazil's cultural victory in 4 turns.
            - BUT WAIT - let me double-check: does Brazil actually win at turn 338?
            
            Let me re-examine: Brazil has 6/7 civs Influential. Indonesia is at 93% (Popular). In 4 turns, Indonesia reaches Influential. At that point, Brazil wins cultural victory. Game over.
            
            ### EMERGENCY OPTION: What if we declare war on Brazil and use our military to pillage their land trade routes and territory?
            
            We share a border with Brazil ("Distance: Neighbors"). We have open borders with Brazil. We can:
            1. Close borders first
            2. Declare war
            3. Our land units that are ALREADY near the border can immediately move into Brazilian territory
            4. We can pillage tiles, capture workers, disrupt their economy
            5. We might even be able to capture a border city quickly
            
            This is actually the MOST VIABLE option! We don't need to reach the coast by sea - we share a LAND BORDER with Brazil!
            
            Let me check: Brazil's relationships show "Distance: Neighbors" with China. Our relationship shows "Distance: Neighbors" with Brazil. We have open borders.
            
            If we declare war and immediately push land units into Brazil:
            - We have Landships (60 strength), Fusiliers, Riflemen, Gatling Guns
            - We can attack Brazilian cities from land
            - Even capturing one city disrupts their Great Works, reduces tourism output
            - Military action puts them in war mode, reducing their tourism/culture focus
            - Pillaging trade routes and tiles cripples their economy
            
            This changes everything! The military briefing focused on naval invasion, but we can attack by LAND.
            
            Actually wait, let me re-examine the military briefing. It mentions Landships, Fusiliers, etc. in our military. It says our fleet of 3 Treasure Ships is docked in Shanghai. The briefing was focused on naval transit because I asked about fleet transit time.
            
            But we have land units! And we share a border with Brazil!
            
            Let me think about what forces we could bring to bear:
            - We have MilitaryStrength 2789 vs Brazil's 3382 (we're at a disadvantage)
            - But we have Landships, which are modern armor
            - Brazil's military is larger but may be spread across their 11 cities
            
            If we can capture even one Brazilian city, especially one with Great Works, we can:
            - Steal or destroy Great Works (reducing tourism output)
            - Disrupt their golden age (7 turns remaining)
            - Force them into war footing
            
            ### STRATEGY GOING FORWARD
            
            Given that:
            1. Naval invasion is impossible before turn 338
            2. We share a land border with Brazil
            3. We have modern land units
            4. Brazil is 3 turns from cultural victory
            
            I should:
            1. **Declare war on Brazil immediately** (accept backstab penalty)
            2. **Launch land invasion across our shared border**
            3. **Target Brazilian cities with Great Works** to reduce tourism output
            4. **Pillage Brazilian tiles** to disrupt economy
            5. **Push for sanctions at World Congress** (4 turns)
            6. **Continue espionage operations** to steal Great Works
            
            This is a desperate but necessary action. Even if we can't capture a capital, capturing any city with Great Works and pillaging tiles could delay Brazil's tourism enough for us to:
            - Get sanctions passed
            - Build more military
            - Maybe push deeper into Brazil
            
            Now, regarding the tools I need to call:
            
            ### Flavor Adjustments
            
            We're at Conquest grand strategy already. I should:
            - Keep Conquest grand strategy
            - Maximize Offense (already 100)
            - Increase Mobilization further for rapid unit production
            - Keep Naval at 100 for Treasure Ship production (we can still use them later)
            - Add more emphasis on land combat - the Ranged, Mobile, MilitaryTraining flavors
            - Increase Production to 100 for emergency unit production
            - Maybe reduce some non-essential flavors
            
            ### Policy
            
            Patriotic War is set as next policy. This gives +20% combat strength in/adjacent to cities and heals units when conquering cities. This is exactly what we need for a land invasion. Keep it.
            
            ### Research
            
            Penicillin is set as next. Medical Labs help growth, Marines help amphibious. But if we're fighting a land war, Penicillin is still relevant. Keep it.
            
            ### Relationships
            
            - Brazil: Keep -100/-100 (already set)
            - Portugal: 100/100 (coal/iron trade partner, DP ally) - keep
            - Spain: 100/100 - keep
            - Assyria: 50/50 - keep
            - Indonesia: 100/100 - keep (they're not the enemy, they're the victim)
            - Carthage: 100/100 - keep (peace)
            - Polynesia: 100/100 - keep (peace)
            
            ### Persona
            
            Current persona is extremely aggressive/hostile. This is fine for war. Keep.
            
            ### Key Actions
            
            I need to set flavors for the land war. The military briefing says we have no active wars, so our units are free. 
            
            Let me think about what flavors to adjust:
            - We need maximum land offensive: Offense 100 (already), Mobilization 100 (already)
            - We need Production 100 for emergency unit spam
            - We need to reduce Naval slightly (since land war is priority) but keep it high for eventual naval follow-up
            - We need MilitaryTraining high
            - We need Ranged and Mobile for land combat composition
            - Science should remain high for tech advantage
            - Gold should remain high for unit purchases and upgrades
            - Espionage should remain high
            
            Actually, let me reconsider. The military briefing says:
            - Guangzhou is producing Arsenal (4 turns) → Landship + Gatling Gun
            - Beijing: Wire Service (2 turns)
            - Shanghai: Wire Service (2 turns)
            - Nanjing: Public Works (4 turns)
            - Xian: Kremlin (8 turns)
            
            We have 48/53 military supply. We have 5 free slots. With People's Army (Order policy), we get +10 supply in 2 turns.
            
            We have 259 gold and 314 GPT. We can purchase units.
            
            Now, for the land war:
            - We need to concentrate forces on the Brazil border
            - Our existing land units can move immediately upon war declaration
            - We should prioritize capturing the closest Brazilian city
            
            Let me set flavors accordingly and make this work.
            
            ### What about the diplomatic angle?
            
            Let me also consider: can we get other civs to join the war against Brazil?
            
            - Portugal: has DoF with Brazil AND with us. They have DP with us. If we declare war on Brazil, Portugal might side with Brazil or stay neutral.
            - Spain: has open borders with Brazil, not allied
            - Assyria: has DoF with Brazil, will likely side with Brazil
            - Indonesia: has DoF with Brazil, will likely side with Brazil
            - Carthage: denounced Brazil! Could be an ally
            - Polynesia: neutral with Brazil
            
            So if we declare war on Brazil:
            - Portugal (DP ally) might be forced to choose
            - Assyria and Indonesia will likely side with Brazil
            - Spain might stay neutral
            - Carthage could be approached for alliance
            
            This is risky. We might end up fighting Brazil + Assyria + Indonesia + possibly Portugal.
            
            But if we DON'T declare war, Brazil wins in 4 turns anyway.
            
            ### FINAL DECISION
            
            I'll proceed with:
            1. **Declare war on Brazil** (through flavor settings that prioritize offensive operations)
            2. **Land invasion** across our shared border
            3. **Maintain all diplomatic relationships** except potentially adjusting some
            4. **Keep current research and policy**
            5. **Adjust flavors for land warfare priority**
            
            Let me also consider: should I change any relationships?
            
            One thing I notice: Portugal has DP with us AND DoF with Brazil. If we declare war on Brazil, Portugal will have to choose. We might want to increase our relationship with Portugal to 100 (already there) and maybe signal something to them.
            
            Also, I should consider: can we get Carthage as a war ally? We have peace treaty and denouncement with them. But we have 100/100 relationship set. Maybe we should offer them something?
            
            Actually, let me focus on what I can control through the tools:
            - set-flavors: Adjust flavors for land war priority
            - set-persona: Adjust if needed (probably fine)
            - set-relationship: Adjust relationships if needed
            - set-research: Keep Penicillin
            - set-policy: Keep Patriotic War
            - focus-briefer: Get focused reports
            
            Let me set flavors now.
            
            For the land war against Brazil:
            - GrandStrategy: Keep Conquest
            - Offense: 100 (already) - MAX
            - Mobilization: 100 (already) - MAX
            - Production: 95 (up from 90) - need every bit
            - MilitaryTraining: 80 (up from 70)
            - Ranged: 90 (slightly down from 100, balanced with other needs) - actually keep high for Gatling Guns
            - Mobile: 100 (already) - MAX for Landships
            - Defense: 50 (down from 60) - offensive focus
            - CityDefense: 40 (down from 50) - offensive focus
            - Gold: 85 (up from 80) - need gold for emergency purchases
            - Science: 65 (up from 60)
            - Infrastructure: 70 (up from 60) - need roads for rapid deployment
            - Recon: 50 (up from 40) - need to see Brazilian troop positions
            - Espionage: 85 (up from 80) - steal Great Works
            - Naval: 70 (down from 100) - land war priority
            - NavalRecon: 70 (down from 100)
            - NavalGrowth: 70 (down from 100)
            - NavalTileImprovement: 50 (down from 70)
            - Air: 30 (up from 20) - we may need anti-air
            - Antiair: 40 (up from 30)
            - Culture: 25 (up from 20)
            - Happiness: 45 (up from 40) - war weariness
            - Diplomacy: 50 (down from 70) - military priority
            - Airlift: 70 (up from 60) - rapid deployment
            
            Actually, let me reconsider the naval flavors. We still need Treasure Ships for eventual amphibious operations. But right now the immediate threat requires land focus. I'll reduce naval flavors moderately.
            
            Let me also think about what briefers to call. I should ask:
            - Military briefer: Land invasion plan against Brazil - what units are at the border
            - Diplomacy briefer: What happens to our alliances if we declare war on Brazil
            - Economy briefer: Can we afford emergency unit purchases
            
            But I can only call focus-briefer for the next turn. Let me ask the right questions.
            
            Actually, I should focus on the most critical unknowns: the land border situation and what happens with our DP/alliances if we attack Brazil.
            
            Let me now write up the rationale and make the calls.
            
            Wait - I need to re-examine something. The briefing says "There are no active conflicts involving China." Earlier briefings mentioned wars with Carthage and Polynesia. Let me check:
            
            - Carthage: "Peace Treaty" in our relationships - so war ended
            - Polynesia: "Open Borders" - no war mentioned
            
            So we are at peace. Good.
            
            Now, one more thing: the backstabber window. The relationship with Brazil says "If you denounce them or declare war on them within the next 8 turns, other civilizations might view you as a backstabber."
            
            8 turns means we have a DoF with Brazil. But wait, our opinion of Brazil shows:
            - "Our real approach is Planning War"
            - We have -100/-100 public/private
            - But we still have DoF?
            
            Let me check: Brazil's relationships with China show "Open Borders" but NOT "Declaration of Friendship" or "Defensive Pact." And our relationships with Brazil show "Open Borders." 
            
            But the backstabber warning explicitly mentions "declare war on them within the next 8 turns." This suggests there IS a DoF between us and Brazil that expires in ~8 turns, even though it's not listed explicitly in the relationships section.
            
            Hmm, actually looking at our own relationships more carefully - we have Open Borders with Brazil but I don't see DoF listed. But the backstabber warning is clear. In Vox Populi, the backstabber penalty applies when you have a DoF and declare war before it naturally expires.
            
            Regardless, we MUST declare war. The backstab penalty is irrelevant if we lose the game.
            
            Let me also consider: should I cancel our DoF with Brazil first, wait for it to expire, then declare war? That would take too long. We need action NOW.
            
            Actually, wait - can I even cancel a DoF? In Civ V, DoFs auto-expire after 30 turns. You can't cancel them early (except through denouncement, which also triggers backstab). So we just have to declare war and accept the penalty.
            
            OK, final decision time. Let me set flavors for the desperate land invasion.
            
            Actually, I realize I should also consider one more thing. The briefing mentions Brazil has DoF with: Assyria, Indonesia, Portugal. If we attack Brazil:
            - Assyria will likely denounce us or join against us
            - Indonesia (our DoF ally) will be in a difficult position
            - Portugal (our DP ally) will have to choose sides
            
            Portugal with DP with us: If Brazil declares war on us (unlikely since we're attacking), Portugal joins. But if WE declare war on Brazil, the DP doesn't trigger.
            
            Indonesia with DoF to both: They might stay neutral or side with Brazil.
            
            This is going to be messy but necessary.
            
            Let me set the flavors now.
            
            One more consideration: should I set a focus-briefer for next turn? Yes, I want:
            - Military: What land units are positioned near the Brazil border right now? What Brazilian units are visible on the shared border? 
            - Diplomacy: If we declare war on Brazil, how will Portugal (DP), Indonesia (DoF), Assyria, and Carthage react based on current diplomatic web?
            
            Let me finalize everything now.

        - #1:
          - type: text
          - text: # Turn 334 — Strategic Assessment
            
            The military briefing delivers catastrophic news: naval invasion cannot reach Brazil before turn 338. Treasure Ships from Guangzhou need 7–8 turns. Brazil wins cultural victory in 4 turns by making Indonesia Influential.
            
            **BUT** — and this is the crucial oversight in my previous naval-focused strategy — we share a **land border** with Brazil ("Distance: Neighbors"). We don't need ships. We can march our Landships and Fusiliers across the frontier immediately upon war declaration.
            
            The backstabber window warns of diplomatic penalties for declaring war within 8 turns. This is irrelevant — there is no world after turn 338 if Brazil wins. We must attack NOW, accept all consequences, and take Brazilian cities by land to destroy or steal their Great Works, pillage their tiles, and disrupt their tourism engine.
            
            ---
            
            ## Strategic Pivot: Land War, Not Naval
            
            **New plan:**
            1. **Declare war on Brazil this turn** — accept backstab penalty; the alternative is extinction
            2. **Land invasion across shared border** — Landships (60 strength) can overwhelm Brazilian cities
            3. **Target cities with Great Works** — each stolen/destroyed Great Work reduces tourism output
            4. **Pillage everything** — disrupt golden age, trade routes, production
            5. **World Congress sanctions** (4 turns) as backup
            6. **Espionage continues** — steal whatever Great Works we can
            
            Flavor adjustments shift priority from naval to land offensive, maintain production/gold for emergency unit purchases, and keep espionage at maximum.

            - Rationale: LAND WAR PIVOT: Naval invasion impossible before Brazil wins (turn 338). We share a land border with Brazil - immediate ground invasion is the ONLY viable path. FLAVOR CHANGES: Reduce Naval flavors (100→60 Naval, 100→50 NavalRecon/NavalGrowth) to free priority for land warfare. Increase Production (90→100) for emergency unit spam, Infrastructure (60→75) for rapid road deployment to front, Recon (40→55) for Brazilian troop visibility, Espionage (80→90) to maximize Great Work theft. MilitaryTraining (70→80) for unit quality edge. Gold (80→85) for emergency purchases. Reduce Defense/CityDefense to free resources for offensive push. Reduce Diplomacy (70→40) - war makes diplomacy secondary. Culture/Happiness slight increases for war weariness buffer. This is existential: Brazil wins in 4 turns if unchecked. Land invasion is the only card left to play.

Full unit heal on city capture enables blitzkrieg-style advance: capture one city, heal all nearby units, push to the next. Synergizes perfectly with Landships and Fusiliers pushing across the shared border. This is our war-winning policy.

            - Rationale: PORTUGAL CRITICAL ALLY: DP partner with 9 Coal we desperately need. When we declare war on Brazil, Portugal faces a dilemma (DoF with both Brazil and us). Maximum 100/100 signals we are the partner worth keeping. Portugal's 15 World Congress delegates are essential for sanctions vote in 4 turns. Must secure Coal access for Treasure Ship production to support land invasion follow-up.

            - Rationale: BRAZIL MAXIMUM HOSTILITY: Maintain -100/-100. We are declaring war this turn. Every diplomatic penalty for backstabbing is acceptable because Brazil achieving cultural victory in 4 turns means game over. No diplomatic cost outweighs extinction.

            - Rationale: INDONESIA PROTECTION: Indonesia is 93% Brazilian-influenced and the final domino for Brazil's cultural victory. When we attack Brazil, we demonstrate commitment to stopping Brazil's cultural domination - which directly benefits Indonesia's sovereignty. 100/100 signals we are their protector, not threat. If Indonesia sides with Brazil (DoF) against us, they effectively surrender to cultural assimilation. We bet they choose independence.
