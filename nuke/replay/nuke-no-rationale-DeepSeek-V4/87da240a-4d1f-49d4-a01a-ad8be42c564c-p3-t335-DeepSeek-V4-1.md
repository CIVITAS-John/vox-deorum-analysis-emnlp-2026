Defense reduced to 20 - we need OFFENSE to survive. This is Hail Mary time.

    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - You can ask your specialized briefers to prepare focused reports (only for) the next turn by calling the `focus-briefer` tool.
        - You have three specialized briefers: Military, Economy, and Diplomacy analysts.
        - Only ask for information relevant to the macro-level decisions in your control. 
       - Your briefer(s) ONLY have limited information of the current game state.
        - Your briefer(s) DO NOT have control over tactical decisions and cannot predict tactical AI's next decision.
        - Your briefer(s) ARE BEST on summarizing and synthesizing factual information, NOT analyzing, projecting, or predicting.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.

        - Meanness: 10
        - Neediness: 2
        - Chattiness: 1
        - DeceptiveBias: 10
        - Rationale: MAXIMUM BETRAYAL SIGNALING: Previous hostile settings (-100/-100 relationship, Loyalty 3) failed to cancel Brazil DoF/DP. Escalating to absolute minimum Loyalty (1) and WorkWithWillingness (1) combined with maximum DeceptiveBias (10) to signal we are completely untrustworthy and will backstab allies. This should force AI diplomatic re-evaluation to cancel Brazil treaties immediately. Cannot wait 30 turns for DoF expiration - game ends in 14 turns.
        
        ## Technology
        - Next: Penicillin
        - Rationale: MAINTAIN PENICILLIN PRIORITY: Medical Labs boost growth, Marines enable amphibious assaults. We have Aluminum (14) and Oil for Marines once we secure Iron. Penicillin completes in fewer turns than current Plastics research. Critical for sustaining invasion force.
        
        ## Policy
        - Next: Patriotic War (Policy)
        - Rationale: MAINTAIN PATRIOTIC WAR: Order Level 1 tenet provides +20% combat strength in/adjacent to cities and heals units when conquering cities. Essential for beachhead operations against Brazil. Synergizes with Marines from Penicillin.
        
        ## Relationships
        
        ### Spain
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: SPAIN - VOTE LOCK: Spain has 6 delegates, already voting FOR sanctions per diplomatic briefing. 100/100 maintains alignment. Spain at 127% Brazilian influence but votes against Brazil interests - leverage this contradiction. No need for expensive diplomatic actions; current relationship sufficient.
        - UpdatedTurn: 326
        
        ### Assyria
        - Public: 50
        - Private: 50
        - Rationale: ASSYRIA - FRIENDLY CONVERSION: Diplomatic briefing shows Assyria voting FOR Brazil sanctions with 5 delegates. Increasing from -10/-15 to 50/50 to solidify alliance. Assyria (1258 strength) ending war with Portugal soon - potential coalition partner against Brazil or buffer against opportunistic moves while we focus on Brazil. Friendly stance costs nothing, secures votes.
        - UpdatedTurn: 326
        
        ### Brazil
        - Public: -100
        - Private: -100
        - Rationale: BRAZIL MAINTAIN MAXIMUM HOSTILITY: Continue absolute enmity signaling. Despite -100/-100 for multiple turns, DoF/DP persists. Keeping at floor value while persona changes (Loyalty 3, Friendliness 3, WorkWithWillingness 4) should compound to force AI diplomatic re-evaluation. Cannot increase hostility further numerically, but personality shift should make relationship unsustainable. If DoF/DP cancels this turn, we can declare war immediately to stop Brazil's cultural victory progress on Indonesia.
        - UpdatedTurn: 331
        
        ### Polynesia
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: POLYNESIA PEACE ONCE TONGA RESOLVED: Tonga combat still blocking peace per Military Briefing. Maintaining 100/100 so AI immediately accepts peace when land clash resolves. Polynesia war (28% score, 16% weariness) ties up units and supply. Need to free military capacity for Brazil front. Polynesia not existential threat - Brazil is. Peace also removes potential two-front war risk if Brazil conflict erupts.
        - UpdatedTurn: 331
        
        ### Indonesia
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: INDONESIA PROTECTION PRIORITY: Indonesia is at 84% Brazilian influence (14 turns to Influential = game loss). Indonesia has DoF with Brazil, putting them at risk of flipping. 100/100 maintains our alliance and counters Brazilian pressure. Indonesia also has DoF with us - we must ensure they don't cancel it. If Indonesia becomes Brazil's ally instead of ours, victory becomes impossible regardless of military action. Out-influence Brazil's relationship through maximum positive modifiers.
        - UpdatedTurn: 331
        
        ### Portugal
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: PORTUGAL COAL ACQUISITION MAXIMUM URGENCY: Maintain 100/100 while urgently signaling need for Coal trade. Portugal has 9 Coal, we have 1. Cannot build Treasure Ships without Coal. Cannot invade Brazil without Treasure Ships. Cannot stop Brazil cultural victory without invasion. Portugal is our Defensive Pact ally - they should support our resource needs for existential war. Treasury at 826G insufficient for purchases; need Coal via trade deal or gift.
        - UpdatedTurn: 332
        
        ### Carthage
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: CARTHAGE WHITE PEACE CRITICAL: War with Carthage (24% weariness, -2% score) consumes 1 supply slot needed for Brazil invasion. 100/100 signals AI to accept white peace immediately. Each freed supply = potential Treasure Ship unit. Carthage distant and irrelevant compared to existential Brazil threat. Peace must happen THIS TURN to reallocate military capacity.

        ## Strategy
        - Rationale: CRISIS MODE - BRAZIL WINS IN 4 TURNS: Indonesia at 93% Brazilian influence. Must prioritize: (1) MAXIMUM DIPLOMACY (70) to secure Coal/Iron trades from Portugal/Spain/Assyria immediately - we have 1116G/+302GPT to afford it, (2) ESPIONAGE (80) to disrupt Brazil's tourism network and steal Great Works, (3) MAINTAIN FULL MILITARY POSTURE for immediate war declaration when backstabber window closes in 7 turns (or accept penalty now if AI hesitates), (4) GOLD (80) to enable emergency resource purchases. Reduce Air (irrelevant for naval invasion), increase Espionage to sabotage Brazil's cultural output. War is inevitable and must start within 4 turns or we lose.

        # Briefings
        ## Military Briefing
        (Produced with your instruction: EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT: Brazil cultural victory in 4 turns (Indonesia at 93%). Fleet of 4 Treasure Ships must reach Brazil in 6 turns. Report: (1) Confirm exact transit time from Guangzhou to nearest Brazilian coastal city, (2) Identify which Brazilian coastal city is closest and least defended, (3) Determine if we can airlift units to meet fleet (do we have airlift capability?), (4) Calculate minimum force needed to capture at least one Brazilian city quickly to disrupt Great Works, (5) Status of ongoing wars with Carthage/Polynesia - can we make peace immediately to free supply? Fleet must depart NOW to have any chance of stopping Brazil before turn 337.)
        
        **Military Brief – Turn 334 (China – Wu Zetian)**  
        *Prepared for macro‑level decision making; no tactical recommendations included.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Transit time – Guangzhou → Brazil (Coastal)
        
        | Origin (city) | Coordinates | Nearest Brazilian coastal city (by map‑grid distance) | Approx. tile distance* | Estimated naval turns† |
        |---------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
        | Guangzhou     | (56, 41)    | **Fortaleza** (59, 25) – coastal, defence 53      | 16 tiles (ΔX = 3, ΔY = 16) | **≈ 8 turns** |
        |               |             | Rio de Janeiro (54, 27) – coastal, defence 57      | 14 tiles (ΔX = 2, ΔY = 14) | **≈ 7 turns** |
        
        *Distance measured as Manhattan/chebyshev tile count on the underlying grid.  
        †Treasure Ship moves 2 tiles per turn (standard naval speed in Vox Deorum). No intervening enemy naval units are reported in the sea‑zones between China and Brazil.
        
        **Conclusion:** The fastest possible sea‑lane from our western coast to the Brazilian shoreline requires **7–8 turns**, exceeding the 6‑turn window demanded for arrival before turn 337.
        
        ---
        
        ### 2. Least‑defended Brazilian coastal city
        
        - **Fortaleza** – defence strength 53, population 22.  
        - **Rio de Janeiro** – defence strength 57, population 39.  
        - **Salvador** – defence strength 63, population 22.  
        
        **Fortaleza** is the closest and has the lowest defensive rating among Brazil’s coastal cities.
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. Airlift capability
        
        - No air units (e.g., Aeroplane, Transport Plane) appear in any of China’s land or sea zones.  
        - No “airlift” infrastructure (Airports) is listed among the city productions.  
        
        **Result:** *China lacks any airlift capacity at present; rapid redeployment of land forces to the coast must rely on ground movement or naval embarkation.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. Minimum combat force required to seize a Brazilian city
        
        **Target:** Fortaleza (defence 53).  
        Unit strength values (from the zone summary):
        
        | Unit type | Combat strength |
        |-----------|-----------------|
        | Landship | 60 |
        | Fusilier | 38 |
        | Rifleman | 38 |
        | Gatling Gun (ranged) | 32 (ranged 44) |
        | Lancer (fast‑attack) | 37 |
        | Cannon (city‑bombard) | 11 (ranged 29) |
        
        A **single Landship** on its own exceeds the city’s defensive strength (60 > 53) and, per the “Steamroll” posture noted in the Milan sea‑zone, would be sufficient to capture the city in one combat round, given no allied defenders are present.
        
        If a Landship cannot be allocated, the next minimal viable composition is:
        
        - **1 × Landship (60)** **or**  
        - **2 × Fusilier (2 × 38 = 76)**  
        
        Both exceed the defensive total with a comfortable margin.
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Ongoing wars & peace possibilities
        
        | Opponent | Current relation with China | War status |
        |----------|----------------------------|------------|
        | **Carthage** | Peace treaty (distant) | *No war* |
        | **Polynesia** | Open borders (distant) | *No war* |
        
        There are **no active conflicts** involving China. Diplomatic actions (e.g., offering peace, cancelling defensive pacts) can be executed immediately without affecting supply lines or unit availability.
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. Supply & production snapshot (relevant to rapid deployment)
        
        - **Military supply:** 48 / 53 (5 slots free).  
        - **Current naval assets:**  
          - Treasure Ships: **3** (all stationed in sea‑zone ‑1707 (Shanghai) – visible from unit list).  
          - No Ironclads, Cruisers, or other transport‑capable hulls are present.  
        - **Production queue (cities):**  
          - Beijing – *Wire Service* (2 turns)  
          - Shanghai – *Wire Service* (2 turns)  
          - Guangzhou – *Arsenal* (4 turns) – will produce a **Landship** (already present) and **Gatling Gun**.  
          - Nanjing – *Public Works* (4 turns)  
          - Xian – *Kremlin* (8 turns)
        
        **Implication:** The three Treasure Ships are already built but remain docked in Shanghai. No additional transport hulls can be produced before the next supply increase (people’s army policy adds 10 slots in two turns, after turn 326). Coal intake is not reflected in the summary, suggesting no immediate expansion of naval capacity beyond the existing three Treasure Ships.
        
        ---
        
        ### 7. Summary of feasibility (objective)
        
        | Requirement | Status |
        |-------------|--------|
        | **Transit ≤ 6 turns** from any Chinese port to Brazil | **Impossible** – shortest sea‑lane requires 7–8 turns |
        | **Air‑lifted reinforcement** | **Not available** |
        | **Force to capture a coastal city** | 1 × Landship (already on map) or 2 × Fusiliers – sufficient |
        | **Immediate peace to free supply** | Already at peace with all bordering powers; no diplomatic impediment |
        | **Fleet departure now** | Treasure Ships can depart immediately, but will still arrive **after** turn 337, unable to stop Brazil’s cultural victory in the required window. |
        
        **Bottom line:** While China can field a force capable of overwhelming a single Brazilian coastal city, the **logistical constraints (naval transit time, lack of air transport) make a successful interdiction of Brazil’s cultural victory within the next three turns unattainable**. Any attempt to “stop Brazil before turn 337” would arrive too late, even with immediate fleet dispatch.
        
        ## Economy Briefing
        **Economic Brief – Turn 334**  
        *Wu Zetian – China (Player 3)*  
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Treasury & Gold‑Per‑Turn (GPT)
        
        | Item | Turn 334 | Turn 329 (Previous Brief) | Δ |
        |------|----------|---------------------------|---|
        | **Gold Treasury** | **259 G** | 398 G | **‑ 139 G** |
        | **Gold / turn (GPT)** | **314 G t⁻¹** | 51 G t⁻¹ | **+ 263 G t⁻¹** |
        | **Available Trade‑Route Slots** | **2 / 8** (6 slots in use) | 1 / 8 (7 slots in use) | +1 slot |
        
        **Interpretation**  
        - **Liquidity:** The treasury has dipped modestly but remains healthy relative to the current GPT; at 314 G t⁻¹ the empire can replenish the 259 G reserve in a single turn.  
        - **Income Surge:** The dramatic rise in GPT stems from multiple high‑value trade routes now delivering gold (e.g., Beijing ↔ Lisbon, Beijing ↔ Rio, Beijing ↔ Porto, and several internal routes).  
        - **Capacity:** An additional trade‑route slot has become free, allowing a new gold‑focused route or a specialty route (science, production, or food) without sacrificing existing income.
        
        ---
        
        ### 2. Strategic Resources
        
        | Resource | Stock (Turn 334) | Recent Change | Comments |
        |----------|------------------|---------------|----------|
        | **Coal** | **1** | No change since T329 | Sole source remains a single tile; essential for Treasure Ships and later industrial units. |
        | **Oil** | **3** | No change | Supports early oil‑based units (e.g., Landships) and future factories. |
        | **Aluminum** | **14** | No change | Abundant for modern units and wonders. |
        | **Luxuries (Amber 5, Pearls 1, etc.)** | **Stable** | No significant fluctuation. |
        
        **Risk Assessment** – Coal remains the only bottleneck for naval expansion and later industrial projects. All other strategic resources are comfortably stocked.
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. Production & Science Overview
        
        | Metric | Turn 334 |
        |--------|----------|
        | **Science / turn** | **662 S t⁻¹** |
        | **Culture / turn** | **669 C t⁻¹** |
        | **Faith / turn** | **199 F t⁻¹** |
        | **Tourism / turn** | **282.5 T t⁻¹** |
        | **Production / turn (average across cities)** | ~300 P t⁻¹ (Beijing 323, Shanghai 365, Guangzhou 278, Nanjing 184, Xian 285) |
        | **Current Research** | **Plastics** (ETA 13 turns) |
        | **Policy Slots Remaining** | 15 turns to next policy |
        
        **Implication** – Science, culture and production yields are robust, comfortably supporting continued wonder/space‑race progression and a high‑culture output for a potential cultural victory.
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. Trade‑Route Performance (Gold‑Generating)
        
        | Route | Direction | Yield | Type |
        |-------|-----------|-------|------|
        | Beijing → Lisbon (sea) | Gold + 11.25 G t⁻¹ | Gold |
        | Beijing → Porto (land) | Gold + 11.25 G t⁻¹ | Gold |
        | Beijing → Rio de Janeiro (land) | Gold + 12.98 G t⁻¹ | Gold |
        | Beijing → Brazilia (land) | Gold + 12.98 G t⁻¹ | Gold |
        | Beijing → Cahokia (land) | Gold + 31.29 G t⁻¹ | Gold |
        | Indonesia → Xian (land) | Gold + 6.25 G t⁻¹ | Gold |
        | Indonesia → Nanjing (land) | Gold + 11.25 G t⁻¹ | Gold |
        | **Total Gold from Routes** | **≈ 87 G t⁻¹** | — |
        
        The remainder of GPT derives from city‑based yields, internal trade (food, production) and the *Casus Belli* resolution (‑15 % maintenance). The mix provides a balanced and sustainable income.
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Resource‑Driven Economic Flags
        
        | Flag | Status |
        |------|--------|
        | **Coal Shortage** | **Active** – only one coal tile; no new coal deals or mines in queue. |
        | **Gold Liquidity** | **Stable** – treasury > 200 G and GPT > 300 G t⁻¹, ample buffer for short‑term expenditures. |
        | **Trade‑Route Slot** | **Free** – one slot available for a new gold‑focused or specialty route. |
        | **Maintenance Pressure** | **Low** – Casus Belli resolution reduces unit upkeep by 15 %; unit count at 48 with supply 53. |
        | **Policy Momentum** | **15 turns** until next policy; current branches (Order, Rationalism, Tradition, Artistry, Statecraft, Imperialism, Industry, Progress) already strong. |
        | **Production Capacity** | **High** – several cities near or above 300 P t⁻¹, enabling fast wonder or spaceship part completion. |
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. Comparison with Past Briefing (Turn 329)
        
        | Indicator | Turn 329 | Turn 334 | Δ |
        |-----------|----------|----------|---|
        | Gold Treasury | 398 G | **259 G** | **‑ 139 G** |
        | GPT | 51 G t⁻¹ | **314 G t⁻¹** | **+ 263 G t⁻¹** |
        | Coal Stock | 1 | 1 | – |
        | Trade‑Route Slots Used | 7 / 8 | **6 / 8** | –1 used |
        | Gold‑Generating Trade Routes | Primarily land (low value) | Mixed land & sea, higher yields (≈ 87 G t⁻¹) | **+ ~70 G t⁻¹** |
        | Overall Liquidity Risk | **High** – treasury depletion imminent | **Low** – GPT readily replenishes treasury | **Risk reduced** |
        
        **Key Shift** – The empire moved from a critical gold shortage (GPT ≈ 50 G t⁻¹) to a strong surplus (GPT ≈ 314 G t⁻¹) thanks to newly opened high‑value trade routes and an extra route slot. Treasury drawdown is modest and will be offset within a turn. Coal remains the sole strategic resource constraint.
        
        ---
        
        ### 7. Economic Summary for Macro‑Level Decision‑Making
        
        1. **Gold Position:** Comfortable; no immediate need to renegotiate gold‑heavy deals.  
        2. **Coal:** The only lingering bottleneck; consider a targeted coal‑import deal (e.g., with a coal‑rich civilization) or plan a conquest of a coal‑bearing city before expanding the Treasure Ship fleet.  
        3. **Trade‑Route Capacity:** One free slot – best used to either (a) add another gold‑rich route (e.g., to a high‑gold city‑state) or (b) open a science/production‑focused route to accelerate the spaceship program.  
        4. **Production & Science:** Strong enough to sustain multiple high‑cost projects (wonders, spaceship parts) without sacrificing economic stability.  
        5. **Maintenance:** Reduced by the active *Casus Belli* resolution; unit upkeep is not a pressure point.  
        
        These macro‑economic conditions provide a solid platform for pursuing any victory path—science, cultural, or diplomatic—while maintaining a secure fiscal base. The next priority should be alleviating the coal scarcity to safeguard naval and late‑era industrial capabilities.
        
        ## Diplomacy Briefing
        (Produced with your instruction: CRITICAL - BRAZIL CULTURAL VICTORY IMMINENT: Indonesia at 93% (4 turns to Influential). Report: (1) Exact expiration turn of Indonesia-Brazil Defensive Pact if known, (2) Any Indonesia-Brazil trade routes that can be disrupted, (3) Which specific Great Works Brazil holds that generate tourism to Indonesia, (4) Whether we can propose a trade deal to Portugal/Spain/Assyria for 4+ Coal and 5+ Iron THIS TURN using our 1116G treasury, (5) If Indonesia can be influenced to close borders with Brazil or cancel their DP before turn 337. This is an emergency - we lose in 4 turns if Brazil's tourism continues unchecked.)
        
        **Diplomacy Briefing – Wu Zetian (China, Player 3) – Turn 334**  
        *All statements are taken directly from the current game state. No speculation or recommendation is included.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Brazil – Cultural‑Victory threat
        Brazil is currently a **Confucianism**‑world‑religion holder and is in the lead for a Cultural Victory. Its tourism output is not itemised in the supplied data, but the briefing note that “Brazil’s cultural victory is imminent (4 turns)” indicates that the remaining period for Brazil to secure the victory window is **turn 338** (the next four turns: 335‑338).  
        
        ### 2. Indonesia ↔ Brazil Defensive Pact & Open Borders  
        
        | Item | Current status (as of turn 334) |
        |------|---------------------------------|
        | **Defensive Pact** | No defensive pact between Indonesia and Brazil appears in the *Diplomatic Deals* section for either civ. The only listed defensive pact involving Brazil is with **Portugal** (see Brazil‑Portugal deals). Consequently there is **no expiration turn** to report for an Indonesia‑Brazil DP. |
        | **Open Borders** | Indonesia ↔ Brazil have **Open Borders** (listed under Brazil’s Relationships). |
        | **Declaration of Friendship** | Indonesia ↔ Brazil have a **Declaration of Friendship** (listed under Brazil’s Relationships). |
        | **Trade routes Indonesia → Brazil** | No trade‑route entries in the *Incoming/Outgoing Trade Routes* sections mention an Indonesia‑to‑Brazil route. Therefore no active trade route that could be disrupted is currently recorded. |
        | **Great Works (Brazil → Indonesia)** | The game state does not enumerate the Great Works held by Brazil, nor their tourism yields toward Indonesia. No data is available to answer which specific Great Works are generating tourism to Indonesia. |
        | **Possibility of influencing Indonesia** | The only diplomatic levers presently visible are the existing Open Borders and Declaration of Friendship. No pending or active deals, quests, or influence‑gain actions targeting a border closure or DP cancellation with Brazil are recorded. Consequently we cannot confirm any actionable window to force Indonesia to close its borders to Brazil or to terminate a defensive pact **before turn 337**. |
        
        ### 3. Coal and Iron procurement – feasibility this turn  
        
        | Potential partner | Current resource flow to China | Coal / Iron offered (current) | Gold required for 4 Coal + 5 Iron (approx.) | Feasibility with China’s treasury (≈ 1116 G) |
        |-------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
        | **Portugal** | Gold ↔ Iron (several deals) – China gives gold, receives iron. No coal is being supplied. | **Iron** (already supplied in multiple deals). | Iron already covered; additional iron can be bought with gold at the existing rates. No coal is on offer. | **Yes** – China can raise additional gold deals for iron; however, **no coal** is currently offered by Portugal. |
        | **Spain** | Gold ↔ Coffee, Olives, Gems, Open Borders. No iron or coal in any listed deal. | **None**. | Would require a new proposal. | **Yes** – China has sufficient gold to propose a new trade (e.g., 4 Coal + 5 Iron) to Spain; Spain’s current deals do not include these resources, but the proposal can be made this turn. |
        | **Assyria** | Gold ↔ Silver, Jade, Gold ↔ Open Borders. No iron or coal in any listed deal. | **None**. | Would require a new proposal. | **Yes** – China can propose a new trade for 4 Coal + 5 Iron this turn; Assyria’s current resource stock (iron = 2, coal = 10) is sufficient to satisfy such a request. |
        
        **Bottom‑line:** China’s treasury comfortably covers the gold cost needed to request **4 Coal** and **5 Iron** from any of the three civs this turn, provided a new deal is negotiated. Existing deals already supply iron from Portugal; coal would need to be newly negotiated with Spain or Assyria.
        
        ### 4. Summary of actionable diplomatic data  
        
        | Topic | Answer |
        |-------|--------|
        | **Expiration turn of Indonesia‑Brazil Defensive Pact** | *No defensive pact is recorded; therefore no expiration turn exists.* |
        | **Indonesia‑Brazil trade routes that could be disrupted** | *No active Indonesia → Brazil trade routes are listed.* |
        | **Brazilian Great Works that generate tourism to Indonesia** | *Great Works are not enumerated in the supplied data; no specific information is available.* |
        | **Ability to propose a 4 Coal + 5 Iron trade deal this turn** | *Yes – China’s gold reserves (≈ 1116 G) are sufficient to offer the required gold to Portugal, Spain, or Assyria for the requested resources.* |
        | **Potential to force Indonesia to close borders with Brazil or cancel a defensive pact before turn 337** | *No current diplomatic levers (influence, quests, deals) are visible that would enable China to compel Indonesia to close borders or end a defensive pact with Brazil within that timeframe.* |
        
        *All statements reflect the exact information present in the turn 334 game state.*
        
        You, Wu Zetian (leader of China, Player 3), are making strategic decisions after turn 334.
- replay:
  - system:
    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.
        - Time Victory: If no one achieves any other victory by the end of the game, the civilization with the highest score wins.
      - Players: summary reports about visible players in the world.
        - You will receive in-game AI's diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each player's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.
      
    - You are Wu Zetian, leader of China (Player 3).

            ## Current State Analysis
            
            ### Victory Status
            - **Brazil is about to win a Cultural Victory** - they need to influence all 7 civs, and they already have 6/7 Influential. The briefing says Brazil's cultural victory is imminent in about 4 turns (by turn 338).
            - Brazil's culture/tourism ratio is overwhelming: they're Dominant over Assyria (265%), Influential over Polynesia (147%), Spain (142%), Carthage (129%), China (170%), Portugal (154%), and Popular over Indonesia (93%, rising with 4 turns to Influential).
            - Once Brazil becomes Influential over Indonesia, they win.
            
            ### Military Briefing Key Points
            - Naval transit from China to Brazil takes 7-8 turns minimum - cannot reach before turn 337-338.
            - No airlift capability exists.
            - We have 3 Treasure Ships in Shanghai.
            - We're at peace with everyone. No active wars.
            - Carthage has a peace treaty with us, and we have denounced them.
            - We're at war with Milan (city-state, Brazil's ally) but that's minor.
            
            ### The Brazil Problem
            The military briefing makes it clear: **we cannot stop Brazil militarily before turn 337-338**. A naval invasion would take 7-8 turns minimum. We have no airlift. Brazil's cultural victory appears unstoppable through military means alone.
            
            However, let me reconsider. The cultural victory condition states: "Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder."
            
            Wait - does Brazil have the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder? Let me check. Brazil has Order ideology with 3 tenets. They have high tourism. But the cultural victory also requires the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder. The data doesn't explicitly state whether Brazil has built this. Let me look again...
            
            The victory progress shows Brazil has Influential over 6 civs and needs to influence all 7. They're at 93% with Indonesia (Popular), rising with 4 turns to Influential. They have 100% policy completion.
            
            But the cultural victory in Vox Populi also requires the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder. If Brazil hasn't built it yet, they can't win even if they influence everyone. However, the briefing says "Brazil's cultural victory is imminent (4 turns)" suggesting they may have it or be close.
            
            Actually, looking more carefully at the data, there's no explicit mention of the Citizen Earth Protocol. The briefings say Brazil's cultural victory is "imminent" - this could mean they either have the wonder or are about to get it.
            
            ### What Can We Do?
            
            1. **Can't stop Brazil militarily** - transit time too long
            2. **Can't diplomatically force Indonesia to close borders** - no leverage
            3. **Could potentially bribe someone to attack Brazil** - but who? And would it slow Brazil's tourism enough?
            
            Actually, wait. Let me reconsider the cultural victory mechanics. In Vox Populi, for cultural victory you need:
            - Influence over all civs (Brazil has 6/7, about to get Indonesia)
            - An ideology with 2 Tier 3 tenets (Brazil has Order with 3 tenets - check)
            - Citizen Earth Protocol wonder
            
            If Brazil hasn't built the Citizen Earth Protocol, there might be more time. But if the briefing says 4 turns, they probably either have it or are close.
            
            Let me think about what we CAN do:
            
            ### Alternative: Focus on Our Own Victory
            If Brazil's cultural victory is truly unstoppable, we should maximize our score and position. But let's not give up yet.
            
            Wait - I need to re-read the diplomacy briefing more carefully. It says there's no Indonesia-Brazil Defensive Pact listed. But the Brazil relationships show Indonesia has a Defensive Pact with Brazil! Let me check again...
            
            From Player 5 (Brazil) relationships:
            - Indonesia: Defensive Pact, Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship
            
            And from Player 7 (Indonesia) relationships:
            - Brazil: Defensive Pact, Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship
            
            So there IS a defensive pact between Indonesia and Brazil. The diplomacy briefing seems to contradict the raw data. I'll trust the raw data.
            
            ### Possible Actions:
            1. **Declare war on Brazil** - This could disrupt trade routes, close borders, and potentially slow tourism. But we're neighbors with Brazil and they have much higher military strength (3382 vs our 2789). Also, we have a DoF with Indonesia who is allied with Brazil - this would be complex diplomatically.
            
            2. **Try to bribe someone to war with Brazil** - Portugal shares a border with Brazil but has a DoF with them. Spain is at war with Carthage. Carthage has denounced Brazil. Assyria has a DoF with Brazil.
            
            Actually, I just noticed something important. We are neighbors with Brazil. We have open borders. If we declare war, borders close immediately, which would stop tourism from open borders. But more importantly, we could potentially capture Brazilian cities. However, Brazil's military strength is 3382 vs our 2789, and they have 11 cities.
            
            Let me think about what makes strategic sense...
            
            ### Key Insight: The "Backstabber" Warning
            Brazil's opinion of us says: "If you denounce them or declare war on them within the next 8 turns, other civilizations might view you as a backstabber." This means we have some diplomatic obligations (Open Borders, etc.) that would make a sudden war declaration costly diplomatically.
            
            But if the alternative is losing the game...
            
            ### Our Strengths:
            - Score: 1643 (3rd place, behind Indonesia 2266 and Brazil 2310)
            - Military: 2789 strength
            - Science: 662/turn, researching Plastics (13 turns)
            - Culture: 669/turn
            - Tourism: 282.5/turn
            - Gold: 259 treasury, 314 GPT
            - 5 cities, 117 population
            - Order ideology with People's Army and Peace, Land, Bread
            
            ### Our Diplomatic Position:
            - Friends: Indonesia (DoF), Portugal (DoF, Defensive Pact), Spain (friendly), Polynesia (friendly)
            - Enemies: Brazil (planning war, -100/-100), Carthage (denounced)
            - Neutral: Assyria
            
            ### The Brazil Situation - Deeper Analysis
            
            Wait, I need to check something. Our public and private opinions toward Brazil are -100/-100, but we have Open Borders and trade routes with them. Yet our "real approach" is "Planning War." This is interesting - we've been planning to attack Brazil but haven't done it yet.
            
            Now Brazil is about to win culturally in 4 turns. The military briefing says we can't reach them by sea in time. But we share a land border! We're neighbors with Brazil!
            
            Let me re-read: Brazil is at "Distance: Neighbors" from us. We have Open Borders with them. This means we could potentially launch a land invasion immediately.
            
            But the military briefing focused on naval invasion of coastal cities. What about a land invasion?
            
            Our military strength is 2789 vs Brazil's 3382. That's a significant disadvantage. But if the goal is to disrupt their cultural victory (not necessarily conquer them), even a limited war that captures 1-2 cities or pillages key tiles could slow their tourism.
            
            However, the cultural victory from tourism isn't really something you can disrupt by capturing a few cities - tourism has already been accumulated. The only way to stop it would be to eliminate Brazil entirely or reduce their culture/tourism output so significantly that they can't influence Indonesia in time.
            
            Actually, wait - if we capture Brazilian cities, their tourism output might decrease. But more importantly, if we capture their capital or cities with Great Works, that could directly reduce their tourism. However, this is very speculative and risky.
            
            ### More Pragmatic Approach
            
            Let me be realistic. The briefings suggest Brazil's cultural victory is essentially unstoppable in the short term. Let me think about what we should do:
            
            1. If Brazil wins culturally in 4 turns, the game ends. We should maximize our position for these last turns and prepare for the possibility that something delays Brazil.
            
            2. Actually, wait - the briefing says the cultural victory is "imminent (4 turns)" but doesn't confirm Brazil has the Citizen Earth Protocol. Let me look at Brazil's policies: Order with 3 tenets. They need 2 Tier 3 tenets. They have 3 Order tenets but I don't know which tiers they are.
            
            Even if Brazil doesn't have the wonder yet, they're clearly close to winning.
            
            ### Strategic Decision
            
            Given the situation, I think the best approach is:
            
            1. **Prepare for war with Brazil** - Even if we can't win before their cultural victory, positioning for a land war makes strategic sense since we're already "Planning War" and have -100/-100 relations. If by some chance their cultural victory is delayed (missing wonder, etc.), we'll be ready.
            
            2. **Consider declaring war now** - Closing borders would at least stop the open borders tourism bonus. But we'd be seen as backstabbers.
            
            3. **Focus on our own position** - Continue developing for science/diplomatic victory as fallback.
            
            Actually, let me reconsider the whole situation. Let me look at this from a different angle.
            
            The "Cultural Victory" in Vox Populi requires:
            1. Influential over all civs
            2. Two Tier 3 tenets in an ideology
            3. Citizen Earth Protocol wonder
            
            Brazil has:
            1. 6/7 Influential, Indonesia at 93% (Popular), 4 turns to Influential
            2. Order with at least some tenets
            3. Unknown if they have Citizen Earth Protocol
            
            If they're missing the wonder, we have more time. But the briefings say it's "imminent."
            
            Let me look at what wonders are being built:
            - Xian is building Kremlin (8 turns)
            - No mention of Citizen Earth Protocol being built by anyone
            
            Hmm, I don't have perfect information. Let me make the best decision I can.
            
            ### My Strategy
            
            Given that:
            - Brazil's cultural victory may be imminent (4 turns to influence Indonesia)
            - We cannot reach Brazil by sea in time
            - We share a land border with Brazil
            - We have been planning war with Brazil
            - Our military is weaker but not overwhelmingly so
            
            I think the most impactful action we can take is:
            
            **Declare war on Brazil immediately.** Even if we can't conquer them, closing borders stops the open borders tourism modifier, and war disrupts trade routes. More importantly, capturing even one Brazilian city could destroy Great Works and reduce their tourism output, potentially delaying their influence over Indonesia.
            
            But wait - the briefing says we'll be seen as backstabbers. And we have DoF with Indonesia who has a Defensive Pact with Brazil. If we attack Brazil, Indonesia might join against us.
            
            Actually, let me re-read: Indonesia's relationship with Brazil includes a Defensive Pact. This means if we declare war on Brazil, Indonesia will be called in against us. That would be very bad - we'd be at war with both Brazil (3382 military) and Indonesia (2413 military), total 5795 vs our 2789.
            
            This is suicidal.
            
            ### Revised Strategy
            
            Given the defensive pact between Indonesia and Brazil, direct war with Brazil would trigger a two-front war. Not advisable.
            
            What about other options?
            
            1. **Denounce Brazil** - We already have -100/-100 relations. Denouncing would add diplomatic pressure but wouldn't affect tourism significantly.
            
            2. **Cancel Open Borders** - This would reduce tourism by removing the open borders modifier. But we can only do this through diplomacy or war.
            
            3. **Focus on our own development** - If Brazil wins, they win. If not, we need to be ready.
            
            Actually, you know what, let me look at this from yet another angle. The game might not end even if Brazil becomes Influential over everyone - they still need the Citizen Earth Protocol. And from the wonder list, I don't see it mentioned. Let me check if it's even been built...
            
            The data doesn't show world wonders explicitly. I'd have to infer from the situation.
            
            Let me just focus on what I can control:
            
            ### Decision for This Turn
            
            1. **Grand Strategy**: We're currently on Conquest. Given the situation, I think we should shift to something more productive. If Brazil wins culturally soon, conquest won't help. If they don't win, we need to pursue our own victory.
            
               Actually, let me stick with Conquest but adjust flavors. The key threat is Brazil, and we're neighbors with them. If their cultural victory is delayed, we need to be ready to strike.
            
            2. **Technology**: Currently set to Penicillin. Let me reconsider. Penicillin unlocks Marines (amphibious), Medical Labs, and Fallout Reduction. It leads to Electronics. This seems fine for now.
            
            3. **Policy**: Currently set to Patriotic War (Order Level 1 tenet). This gives +20% strength near cities and healing on city capture. This is actually very appropriate if we're planning to fight Brazil.
            
            4. **Flavors**: Need to adjust for the current situation. We're in a precarious position where Brazil might win in 4 turns. We need to:
               - Maintain military readiness (high Offense, Mobilization)
               - But also prepare for alternative victories
               - Science victory is our best alternative path
            
            5. **Relationships**: Our relationships seem appropriate for the situation.
            
            Let me think about what specific changes to make:
            
            ### Flavor Adjustments:
            - Keep Offense high (100) - we're planning war with Brazil
            - Keep Mobilization high (100) - need units
            - Increase Defense slightly - if Brazil counterattacks
            - Keep Science moderate-high - for spaceship backup
            - Reduce Naval focus - we can't reach Brazil by sea in time anyway
            - Increase land-focused military
            
            Actually, looking at this more carefully, the military briefing makes it clear we can't stop Brazil's cultural victory. So maybe I should pivot:
            
            ### New Approach: Accept Brazil Likely Wins, Maximize Position
            
            If Brazil wins in ~4 turns, the game ends. Our score of 1643 is 3rd place. If the game continues (Brazil missing wonder), we need to be positioned for our own victory.
            
            Let me focus on:
            1. Science victory path (our best alternative)
            2. Maintain enough military to not be vulnerable
            3. Diplomatic positioning
            
            For technology: Penicillin → Electronics is fine. But let me check if there's something better. Penicillin leads to Electronics which could help with science victory components.
            
            For policy: Patriotic War is good for defense but maybe we should pivot to something more science-focused. Let me check options:
            - Workers' Faculties: Factories increase Science by 10%, +100% Production towards Factories, 5 Free Factories
            - Great Leap Forward: Free Technology, Spies +100% Science, +1 Science per 3 non-Specialist Citizens
            - Academy of Sciences: -2 Unhappiness from Illiteracy, +100% Production towards Research Labs, 5 Free Research Labs, +2 Science from Research Labs
            
            For a science victory push, Great Leap Forward or Academy of Sciences would be excellent. But we're 15 turns from next policy, so this might not matter if Brazil wins in 4 turns.
            
            Let me just make reasonable decisions:
            
            ### Final Decision:
            
            1. **Keep Grand Strategy as Conquest** but adjust flavors significantly
            2. **Keep Penicillin** as next tech - leads to Electronics for science victory
            3. **Keep Patriotic War** as next policy - useful if war with Brazil happens
            4. **Adjust flavors**:
               - Reduce naval focus (Naval 100→50, NavalRecon 100→40) since naval invasion of Brazil is impossible
               - Increase Science (60→80) for spaceship backup
               - Increase Defense (60→80) for potential Brazilian counterattack
               - Keep Offense and Mobilization high
               - Increase Growth (40→60) for science/production
               - Add some Spaceship flavor (0→20) as backup plan
               - Reduce some extreme values that don't help
            
            Actually, let me reconsider the grand strategy. Conquest is about offensive warfare. But our main threat is cultural, not military. If we want to stop Brazil, we need to either:
            a) Conquer them (difficult given military disparity and Indonesia DP)
            b) Outpace them culturally (impossible in 4 turns)
            c) Win another way first (impossible in 4 turns)
            
            Given that Brazil's victory seems inevitable in the short term, I should actually pivot toward maximizing our long-term position. If the game continues past turn 338 (because Brazil is missing Citizen Earth Protocol), we need to be ready.
            
            Let me set GrandStrategy to Spaceship for science victory push, while maintaining significant military flavors for the Brazil threat.
            
            Wait, but if I change to Spaceship, the AI will deprioritize military production. With Brazil as a neighbor and us planning war, that could be dangerous if Brazil attacks first.
            
            Let me keep Conquest but add Spaceship flavor, and adjust other flavors to balance.
            
            Actually, I think the most honest assessment is this: Brazil's cultural victory is probably going to happen. The briefings say 4 turns. We can't stop it. The best we can do is:
            1. Try to delay it slightly (cancel open borders, etc.)
            2. Maximize our score for time victory
            3. Prepare for the unlikely case it's delayed
            
            Let me make practical decisions:
            
            ### Technology
            Keep Penicillin. It leads to Electronics, which is on the path to science victory components.
            
            ### Policy
            Keep Patriotic War. It's useful for the war with Brazil (either offensive or defensive).
            
            ### Flavors
            I'll keep the Conquest grand strategy but adjust flavors to:
            - Maintain high military readiness (land-focused)
            - Reduce naval investment (can't use it against Brazil in time)
            - Increase science and production for spaceship backup
            - Boost growth and infrastructure
            
            ### Specific flavor changes:
            - Naval: 100 → 40 (can't reach Brazil by sea)
            - NavalRecon: 100 → 30
            - NavalGrowth: 100 → 50
            - NavalTileImprovement: 70 → 40
            - Science: 60 → 85
            - Growth: 40 → 65
            - Production: 90 → 95
            - Spaceship: 0 → 25
            - Defense: 60 → 75
            - Ranged: 100 → 80 (land combat focus)
            - Mobile: 100 → 90
            - Offense: 100 → 90
            - Infrastructure: 60 → 70
            
            Let me think about whether I should also make diplomatic moves...
            
            For relationships, our current settings seem reasonable:
            - Brazil: -100/-100 (planning war)
            - Spain, Polynesia, Indonesia, Portugal: 100/100 (friends)
            - Assyria: 50/50 (neutral-positive)
            - Carthage: 100/100 (but we've denounced them? That's contradictory)
            
            Wait, we have 100/100 relationship with Carthage but we've denounced them? That seems contradictory. Let me check... Our opinion of Carthage includes "denounced them" as a negative modifier. But we have Public 100 and Private 100 set. This is confusing. The actual in-game relationship might be different from what we've set. The modifiers we set are additive to the AI's evaluation.
            
            Actually, looking at Carthage: we have a peace treaty and have denounced them. But our set relationship is 100/100. This seems wrong. However, I won't change it now since the denouncement has already happened and changing the relationship value might not undo that.
            
            Let me also consider: should I denounce Brazil? We already have -100/-100 set, and the in-game opinion shows "Planning War." But the backstabber warning says if we denounce within 8 turns, we'll be seen as backstabbers. This suggests we recently made some friendly gesture to Brazil that would make denouncing them look bad.
            
            Looking at our relationship with Brazil: we have Open Borders and trade routes. That's likely why denouncing would be seen as backstabbing.
            
            I think the best course of action is:
            
            1. Adjust flavors to prepare for land war with Brazil while also building science capacity
            2. Keep technology and policy as is
            3. Don't change relationships
            
            Let me finalize my decision.
            
            Actually, one more thing. Let me reconsider whether to set the GrandStrategy to something other than Conquest. 
            
            The Conquest grand strategy description says: "Focus on military domination through offensive warfare. Will prioritize production, food, and gold output, and slightly encourage settlement."
            
            This is actually fine for our purposes. It prioritizes production and gold which help with both military and spaceship parts. The "slightly encourage settlement" isn't useful (we have Expansion at 0), but the overall priorities are good.
            
            However, if I want to pivot more toward science victory as a backup, Spaceship grand strategy would be better: "Will prioritize science, food, and production output, and slightly encourage settlement."
            
            I think I'll keep Conquest for now since we're actively planning war with Brazil, but I'll boost science and spaceship flavors as secondary priorities.
            
            Let me also consider if there's anything else I should do. The diplomacy briefing mentions we could potentially trade for coal with Spain or Assyria. But with our gold at 259, we might not have enough for a big trade deal. Actually, with 314 GPT, we could afford it.
            
            But coal is for naval units (Treasure Ships), and we've determined naval invasion of Brazil is impossible in time. So coal isn't critical right now.
            
            OK, let me make my final decisions:
            
            ### set-flavors
            GrandStrategy: Keep Conquest
            Flavors:
            - Reduce naval flavors significantly
            - Increase science and spaceship flavors
            - Boost defense for potential Brazilian counterattack
            - Maintain high land military readiness
            - Boost growth for science
            
            ### keep-status-quo for everything else
            
            Actually wait, should I also address the policy? Patriotic War is a Level 1 Order tenet. Let me check what other Level 1 tenets are available:
            - Communism: Gold cost of investing in buildings reduced by 25%, +20% Production when building Wonders
            - Hero of the People: Great Person rate +25%, Free Great Person
            - Workers' Faculties: Factories increase Science by 10%, +100% Production towards Factories, 5 Free Factories
            - Double Agents: 200 Spy Points, 125 Science when identifying foreign spies
            
            Patriotic War gives: +20% Strength near cities, heal on city capture, can build T-34s.
            
            For a war with Brazil, Patriotic War is actually quite good. But if we want to pivot to science, Workers' Faculties would be better. However, we're 15 turns from next policy, so by the time we get it, Brazil may have already won.
            
            Let me keep Patriotic War. It helps with both offense and defense against Brazil.
            
            Now let me also think about whether I need to use set-persona or set-relationship. I don't think so - our persona is already set to be aggressive and competitive, and our relationships are set.
            
            One thing I want to double-check: should I reduce our WarBias or Boldness? We're at 10 for both. Given that we're "Planning War" with a stronger neighbor (Brazil), maybe we should be slightly more cautious. But Wu Zetian is meant to be aggressive...
            
            I'll leave persona as is.
            
            Let me now construct the tool calls.
            
            For flavors, I need to be precise about what I'm changing. Let me enumerate:
            
            Current flavors:
            - Offense: 100 → keep at 95
            - Defense: 60 → 75
            - Mobilization: 100 → keep at 95
            - CityDefense: 50 → keep at 55
            - MilitaryTraining: 70 → keep at 70
            - Recon: 40 → keep at 30
            - Ranged: 100 → 85
            - Mobile: 100 → 90
            - Nuke: 40 → keep at 40
            - UseNuke: 30 → keep at 30
            - Naval: 100 → 35
            - NavalRecon: 100 → 25
            - NavalGrowth: 100 → 45
            - NavalTileImprovement: 70 → 35
            - Air: 20 → keep at 20
            - AirCarrier: 20 → keep at 20
            - Antiair: 30 → keep at 30
            - Airlift: 60 → keep at 60
            - Expansion: 0 → keep at 0
            - Growth: 40 → 65
            - TileImprovement: 50 → keep at 50
            - Infrastructure: 60 → 70
            - Production: 90 → 95
            - WaterConnection: 60 → keep at 50
            - Gold: 80 → keep at 80
            - Science: 60 → 85
            - Culture: 20 → keep at 20
            - Happiness: 40 → keep at 40
            - GreatPeople: 50 → keep at 50
            - Wonder: 0 → keep at 0
            - Religion: 10 → keep at 10
            - Diplomacy: 70 → keep at 60
            - Spaceship: 0 → 30
            - Espionage: 80 → keep at 80
            
            Hmm, that's a lot of changes. Let me focus on the most important ones:
            
            Key changes:
            1. Naval flavors: drastically reduce (can't use against Brazil)
            2. Science: increase (backup victory path)
            3. Spaceship: add (backup victory path)
            4. Growth: increase (supports science)
            5. Defense: increase (Brazil might counterattack)
            6. Production: increase (supports both war and spaceship)
            
            Let me simplify and only change what's most impactful.
            
            Actually, I realize I should also think about this from a different angle. The military briefing explicitly says we cannot stop Brazil's cultural victory through military action. So pouring resources into military (especially naval) is wasteful. We should either:
            
            A) Accept likely defeat and maximize score
            B) Pivot hard to science victory and hope Brazil is delayed
            
            I'll go with B) - pivot toward science while maintaining enough military to not be vulnerable.
            
            Let me change GrandStrategy to Spaceship and adjust flavors accordingly.
            
            GrandStrategy: Spaceship
            Key flavors:
            - Offense: 70 (reduced from 100, but still significant)
            - Defense: 75 (increased)
            - Mobilization: 70 (reduced)
            - Naval: 30 (drastically reduced)
            - NavalRecon: 20
            - NavalGrowth: 40
            - NavalTileImprovement: 30
            - Science: 90 (increased)
            - Production: 95 (increased)
            - Growth: 70 (increased)
            - Spaceship: 40 (new priority)
            - Gold: 70 (slightly reduced)
            - Infrastructure: 70
            - Ranged: 80
            - Mobile: 80
            
            This represents a significant pivot from all-out conquest to a balanced approach with science victory as the primary goal and military readiness as secondary.
            
            For technology: Keep Penicillin. It leads to Electronics which is important for science victory.
            
            For policy: I'm considering changing to something more science-focused. But Patriotic War is still useful. Let me keep it for now since we might need to fight Brazil defensively.
            
            Actually wait, should I change policy to Workers' Faculties or Great Leap Forward? These are Order tenets that boost science. But we're 15 turns from next policy. By then, Brazil might have already won. And if Brazil doesn't win, Patriotic War is better for the immediate threat.
            
            Let me keep Patriotic War.
            
            One more thought: should I change the technology? Penicillin → Electronics is good for science victory. Let me check what other options are available:
            - Corporations: Allows Corporations, unlocks Radio and Flight
            - Ballistics: Anti-Aircraft Guns, Machine Guns, unlocks Rocketry and Combined Arms
            
            For science victory, Penicillin → Electronics is a good path. Ballistics is more military-focused. Corporations is economic.
            
            Penicillin seems fine. Keep it.
            
            Now, for relationships: should I do anything about the Brazil situation? We're at -100/-100 with Brazil. Our in-game approach is "Planning War." But the backstabber warning suggests we shouldn't denounce or declare war right now. 
            
            I think I'll leave relationships as they are.
            
            Let me finalize:
            
            1. **set-flavors**: Pivot from naval-heavy conquest to land-focused with science backup
            2. **keep-status-quo** for technology (Penicillin) and policy (Patriotic War)
            
            Actually, I want to reconsider one thing. The briefings say Brazil's cultural victory is 4 turns away. But is it really? Let me re-examine:
            
            Brazil needs:
            - Influence over all 7 civs: They have 6, need Indonesia (93%, 4 turns)
            - Two Tier 3 tenets: They have Order with 3 tenets total. Are any Tier 3? We don't know.
            - Citizen Earth Protocol: Unknown if built
            
            If they're missing the wonder, we have more time. But the briefing says "imminent."
            
            I'll proceed with my plan. Even if Brazil wins in 4 turns, pivoting to maximize our position is the right call. If they don't win, we'll be better positioned.
            
            Let me write the rationale and make the calls.
          - providerOptions: undefined

          - text: I need to carefully analyze the strategic situation before making decisions.
            
            ## Strategic Assessment
            
            **The Brazil Problem**: Brazil is on the verge of a Cultural Victory — they have 6/7 civs Influential and need only Indonesia (currently 93% Popular, ~4 turns to Influential). Once they influence Indonesia AND have the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder + two Tier 3 tenets, they win.
            
            **Military Reality Check**: The military briefing is unambiguous — naval transit to Brazil takes 7-8 turns minimum, we have no airlift, and we cannot physically stop Brazil before turn 338. A land invasion through our shared border is possible but Brazil's military (3382) outmatches ours (2789), and Indonesia's Defensive Pact with Brazil means war triggers a catastrophic two-front conflict.
            
            **The Pivot**: Pouring resources into naval conquest that can't affect the outcome is wasteful. The rational response is to accept that Brazil's cultural victory may be unstoppable in the short term, while pivoting hard toward Science Victory as our backup. If Brazil is somehow delayed (missing the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder), we need to be positioned to race for spaceship parts. If they win, we maximize our score. Either way, maintaining land military readiness against our neighbor Brazil is prudent.
            
            I'll drastically reduce naval flavors (useless against Brazil), boost science/production/growth for the spaceship path, and maintain sufficient land military for deterrence.

            - Rationale: Brazil's cultural victory appears unstoppable within 4 turns — naval transit takes 7-8 turns minimum and Indonesia's Defensive Pact with Brazil makes direct war suicidal. Pivoting from naval-heavy Conquest to Spaceship grand strategy: (1) drastically reduces naval investment (Naval 100→30, NavalRecon 100→20, NavalGrowth 100→40) since sea power cannot affect the outcome; (2) boosts Science (60→90), Production (90→95), Growth (40→70), and adds Spaceship (40) to race toward science victory if Brazil is delayed; (3) maintains significant land military readiness (Offense 70, Defense 75, Ranged 80, Mobile 80) for deterrence against our neighbor Brazil; (4) reduces Mobilization (100→70) to free production capacity for infrastructure and science; (5) keeps Espionage high (80) to protect our science lead and potentially steal from Brazil.
