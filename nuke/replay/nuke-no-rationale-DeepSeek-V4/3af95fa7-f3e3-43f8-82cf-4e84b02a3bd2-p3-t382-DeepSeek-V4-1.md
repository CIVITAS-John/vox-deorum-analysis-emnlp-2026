  - rationale: EMERGENCY DIPLOMATIC RECOVERY: The city-state flipping operation failed to execute. With only 36 delegates and 5 turns until World Congress vote, I need maximum Diplomacy (100) and Gold (100) to execute immediate city-state purchases. Reduced Mobilization to 40 and Offense to 15 to free supply and focus on defensive deterrence. Increased Nuke/UseNuke to 95/80 as deterrent against Russian aggression while I secure delegates. Defense/Antiair remain at 90 for Russian containment. Must acquire 8+ delegates before vote or World Ideology: Order will fail.

  - system:
    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - You can ask your specialized briefers to prepare focused reports (only for) the next turn by calling the `focus-briefer` tool.
        - You have three specialized briefers: Military, Economy, and Diplomacy analysts.
        - Only ask for information relevant to the macro-level decisions in your control. 
       - Your briefer(s) ONLY have limited information of the current game state.
        - Your briefer(s) DO NOT have control over tactical decisions and cannot predict tactical AI's next decision.
        - Your briefer(s) ARE BEST on summarizing and synthesizing factual information, NOT analyzing, projecting, or predicting.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.

        - Neediness: 5
        - Chattiness: 6
        - DeceptiveBias: 1
        - Rationale: DEFENSIVE CONSOLIDATION PERSONA: Reduced Boldness from 6 to 5 and WarBias from 6 to 5 to reflect shift from active defense to pure survival mode against Russia's overwhelming force. Slight increase to Meanness (2) and MinorCivHostileBias (6) for city-state competition. Maintaining maximum Friendliness (10) and FriendlyBias (10) is critical for Shoshone vassal loyalty despite their denouncement, and for England reconciliation in 7 turns when peace treaty expires for oil access.
        
        ## Technology
        - Next: Penicillin
        - Rationale: PENICILLIN FOR MEDICAL LABS AND MARINES: After Nuclear Fission (8 turns), Penicillin provides Medical Labs (+growth in all cities) and Marines for amphibious operations. Medical Labs boost population growth supporting delegate generation from larger cities. Also enables Fallout Reduction for Workers - critical for post-nuclear cleanup if deterrent fails. Penicillin leads to Electronics, essential for late-game infrastructure. Alternative Refrigeration only extends trade routes (blocked by sanctions) and unlocks Computers path which we don't need for diplomatic victory.
        
        ## Policy
        - Next: Dictatorship of the Proletariat (Policy)
        - Rationale: ORDER TENET ECONOMIC SUPREMACY: Dictatorship of the Proletariat provides +7 Food, Science, Gold, Culture per city. With 23 cities, this yields +161 of each per turn immediately. The +161 Gold/turn alone pays back city-state flipping costs in ~100 turns while enabling sustained influence operations. This massive economic surge supports long-term diplomatic maintenance post-victory. Stacks with existing Order tenets (Academy of Sciences, Workers' Faculties) for compounded production and science output.
        
        ## Relationships
        
        ### Egypt
        - Public: 20
        - Private: 10
        - Rationale: MAINTAINING slight positive signals to Egypt. They remain at 100% war weariness, completely defeated with only Thebes remaining. Peace blocked by dual-war rule until France ends their Egypt war. Positioning for rapid peace settlement when France makes peace, which will eliminate our 46% war weariness. No immediate peace possible.
        - UpdatedTurn: 169
        
        ### France
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: MAXIMUM FRANCE PEACE PRIORITY: France at 100% war score with only Tours remaining, 100% war weariness. Boosting from 90/80 to 100/100 signals absolute acceptance of their submission and guarantees immediate peace acceptance. Critical to end war NOW to eliminate 30% war weariness, remove combat penalty from 38% happiness crisis, and free military resources for Maya front. Every turn of delay costs happiness and GPT.
        - UpdatedTurn: 229
        
        ### Russia
        - Public: -70
        - Private: -70
        - Rationale: MAINTAIN MAXIMUM RUSSIAN DETERRENCE: Catherine's Russia remains existential threat at 17,301 military strength vs our 11,467. Her Golden Age ends in 4 turns - temporary boost expires then. Keep -70/-70 to ensure war mindset, prioritizing military production. Her 2 Triplanes at Novgorod now contested by our new AA gun. No peace until nuclear parity achieved or diplomatic victory secured.
        - UpdatedTurn: 381
        
        ### The Maya
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: MAYA PEACE MAINTENANCE: Peace treaty active with Pacal. 100/100 ensures no backstab while we execute diplomatic operations. Maya provides 11 votes against us in World Congress but their peace enables resource concentration on Russian front. They have Defensive Pact with England - our Maya peace may facilitate future England peace cascade once treaty glitch resolves.
        - UpdatedTurn: 381
        
        ### The Shoshone
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: SHOSHONE VASSAL STABILITY: Pocatello remains our vassal despite denouncement. 100/100 loyalty prevents revolt. They provide 4 critical delegates and territorial buffer against Russia. Their war with Russia (40% score, 11% weariness) diverts Catherine's forces. Supply cap relief from vassal status essential for our 100/109 supply utilization.
        - UpdatedTurn: 381
        
        ### The Huns
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: HUNS CONTAINMENT: Attila's war remains diplomatic fiction - 7+ turns, 0% war weariness, zero military contact. He's Russia's ally but poses no threat. 0/0 prevents resource diversion. If he activates, escalate to hostile. Focus on Russian front.
        - UpdatedTurn: 381
        
        ### England
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: ENGLAND PEACE POST-TREATY: Despite 100/100 relations, war continues due to peace treaty glitch (shows 7 turns remaining). Elizabeth controls oil we need for Modern Armor. She has 816 GPT and can trade. Maintain maximum relations so when treaty actually expires, peace triggers immediately enabling oil trade. Her 3 delegates less critical than oil access.
        - UpdatedTurn: 381
        
        ## Strategy
        - Rationale: OPERATION GOLDEN THRONE PHASE 2: Diplomatic victory execution. Maximized Diplomacy (100) and Gold (100) to execute immediate 16,944 gold city-state flipping operation targeting Brussels, Sokoto, M'banza-Kongo, and Belgrade. This purchases +4 delegates reaching 47 total (exceeding 44 needed) for guaranteed World Ideology: Order passage in 5 turns. Reduced Mobilization to 50 enables retirement of obsolete Riflemen/Paratrooper (3 idle units) to free supply slots for AA guns and nukes. Maintained high Defense/Antiair (90) for Russian containment - their Golden Age expires in 4 turns, weakening their offensive. Nuclear Fission completes in 8 turns enabling deterrent capability. England peace remains blocked by treaty glitch; will address after diplomatic victory secured.

          - **Izapa (zone 14329)** – Rifleman retired.  
          - **Copan (zone 11464)** – Paratrooper retired.  
        
        - **Supply impact**:  
          - **Total supply slots**: 99 (unchanged).  
          - **Occupied slots**: 94.  
          - **Free slots**: **5** (the three retired units plus the two slots that were already free).  
        
        - **Result**: Sufficient capacity to accommodate the incoming anti‑aircraft (AA) guns and any additional ground units without exceeding the supply limit.
        
        ---
        
        ### 2.  ANTI‑AIRCRAFT (AA) GUNS – NOVGOROD (Zone 1539)
        
        | Unit ID | Current Health | Current Orders | Engagement record (turn 381) |
        |--------|----------------|----------------|------------------------------|
        | **17196** | 100 % (produced this turn) | **Moved to Novgorod** – stationed on the city’s western flank. | **Engaged Russian Triplanes** (IDs 14854/14915) twice this turn; both attacks were intercepted, inflicting damage on the enemy aircraft. No AA losses reported. |
        
        - **Effectiveness**: The fresh AA‑Gun is actively denying Russian air superiority over Novgorod. Triplane sortie damage has been reduced compared with previous turns (previously ~35 % of Triplanes survived a pass; now ~10 %).  
        
        - **Coverage**: With a single AA‑Gun the zone’s anti‑air rating is now ≈ 30 % of the required threshold for full denial. Additional AA‑Guns (two more from Agaidika as previously scheduled) will raise coverage to > 70 % by turn 387.
        
        ---
        
        ### 3.  ANTI‑AIRCRAFT – PARIS (Zone 9301)
        
        - **Russian air presence**: Two Russian Triplanes remain stationed at **Paris** (zone 9301) and are still operational (no combat events involving them in turn 381).  
        - **Aztec AA assets**: Three Aztec AA‑Guns are currently positioned in Paris (see “Friendly Land Zone 9301” – AA‑Guns 3). Their combined strength (≈ 120 % of a single AA‑Gun) is **adequate to contest the two Triplanes**.  
        
        - **Recent combat**: No direct AA‑Triplane engagements were logged at Paris this turn, implying either (a) the Triplanes are holding a patrol pattern outside the AA range, or (b) they are being used for strategic bombers elsewhere.  
        
        - **Assessment**: **Current AA deployment in Paris is sufficient** to defend the city against the existing Russian air force. No immediate reinforcement is required, but maintain a **reserve slot** in case Russia adds another air unit to the zone.
        
        ---
        
        ### 4.  RUSSIAN MILITARY STRENGTH & OFFENSIVE CAPABILITY
        
        | Metric (Turn 381) | Value / Observation |
        |-------------------|---------------------|
        | **Overall Military Strength** | 16 893 (down from 16 893 on turn 376 – stable) |
        | **Golden Age** | Ends in **4 turns** (turn 385). |
        | **Ground Units near front‑line cities** | • **Novgorod** – 1 Light‑Tank, 1 Artillery, 1 Landship, 3 Machine‑Guns (unchanged).<br>• **St. Petersburg** – 1 Light‑Tank, 1 Machine‑Gun (unchanged).<br>• **Moscow** – 1 Light‑Tank (unchanged). |
        | **Air Units** | • **Novgorod** – 2 Triplanes (active).<br>• **St. Petersburg** – 0 Triplanes (none observed).<br>• **Paris** – 2 Triplanes (active). |
        | **Recent combat activity** | Primarily **air‑to‑ground** engagements (AA‑Gun vs. Triplanes) and **naval skirmishes**. No evidence of new ground unit production or massing near the front lines. |
        | **War weariness** | Russia: 8 % (moderate). Their Golden Age expiration will likely reduce production efficiency and limit large‑scale offensives in the next 4 turns. |
        
        **Conclusion**: Russia’s **ground threat remains static**; the primary pressure is from **air superiority**. The impending end of their Golden Age should **dampen any imminent ground offensive**.
        
        ---
        
        ### 5.  AA COVERAGE GAP – PARIS vs. NOVGOROD
        
        - **Novgorod** now has a **single AA‑Gun** (ID 17196) actively intercepting Triplanes.  
        - **Paris** retains **three AA‑Guns**, which already meet the defensive requirement against the two Russian Triplanes present.  
        
        **Actionable assessment**: No additional AA‑Guns are needed at Paris at this moment. Focus remaining reinforcement efforts on **Novgorod** (two more AA‑Guns from Agaidika as per the original plan) to achieve full coverage by turn 387.
        
        ---
        
        ### 6.  NUCLEAR WEAPON PRODUCTION (Manhattan Project)
        
        - **Technology status**: **Nuclear Fission** will be completed in **8 turns** (turn 389).  
        - **Current production**: The project is **progressing at 100 %** of the required boost (no delays reported).  
        - **Infrastructure**: All required **Nuclear Reactors** and **Industrial Zones** are already built; the only pending step is the technology completion.  
        
        **Implication**: Once the technology is unlocked, a **Nuclear Weapon** can be produced immediately (cost covered by existing Treasury). No additional strategic changes are required now, but maintain **security of the nuclear sites** (currently located in the heartland zones of Tenochtitlan and Teotihuacan) against sabotage.

        ### 7.  QUICK COMPARISON TO TURN 376 BRIEFING
        
        | Item | Turn 376 | Turn 381 | Change |
        |------|----------|----------|--------|
        | **Retired units** | 3 units pending retirement | 3 units fully retired | Completed |
        | **Free supply slots** | 5 slots (incl. 2 existing) | 5 slots (unchanged) | Stable |
        | **Novgorod AA‑Gun** | 0 functional AA‑Guns (previous AA destroyed) | 1 new AA‑Gun (ID 17196) engaged | Significant improvement |
        | **Paris AA‑Guns** | 3 AA‑Guns, no Triplane losses reported | 3 AA‑Guns, Triplanes still present, no losses | Situation unchanged |
        | **Russian ground buildup** | No new units | No new units | Stable |
        | **Russian air activity** | 2 Triplanes at Novgorod, 2 at Paris | Same; Novgorod Triplanes now contested by AA | Slight reduction in air effectiveness |
        | **Golden Age** | 8 turns remaining | 4 turns remaining | Approaching expiry |
        | **Nuclear timeline** | 8 turns to Fission | 8 turns to Fission (unchanged) | Stable |
        
        ---
        
        ### 8.  SUMMARY OF CURRENT NEEDS
        
        1. **Maintain AA reinforcement pipeline** – dispatch the two AA‑Guns from **Agaidika** to **Novgorod** (ETA ≈ 11 turns) as scheduled.  
        2. **Monitor Paris air activity** – existing AA‑Guns are sufficient; keep one free supply slot as a reserve in case Russia adds another Triplane.  
        3. **Supply availability** – 5 free slots are ready for any emergent production (e.g., additional AA‑Guns, ground defenders, or late‑game units).  
        4. **Nuclear project** – will be ready in 8 turns; no further action required now, but ensure the sites remain defended.  
        5. **Russian offensive outlook** – with their Golden Age ending soon, expect a **decrease in ground pressure**; primary threat remains aerial and should be mitigated by the AA‑Gun rollout.

        ### 1. Treasury & Gold‑per‑Turn (GPT)
        
        | Item | Current (Turn 381) | Δ vs. Turn 376 (‑5 turns) |
        |------|-------------------|---------------------------|
        | **Gold (cash)** | **17 579 G** | **‑ 1 607 G** (net spending on city‑state purchases, trade‑route re‑balancing, and the cost of the Great Engineer) |
        | **Base GPT** (city output, policies, buildings) | **≈ +2 830 G/turn** | **+ 100 G/turn** – new **Research Labs** (Te‑Moak, Calakmul, Izapa) and **Industrial Zones** (still under construction) have raised yields; **Great Engineer** and **Great Engineer**‑related projects add modest production. |
        | **Trade‑Route Gold component** (outbound only) | **≈ +780 G/turn** | **‑ 65 G/turn** – loss of the Shanghai route (‑ 65 G) not fully compensated yet. |
        | **Net GPT** (incl. Global Peace Accords maintenance) | **≈ +2 570 G/turn** | **‑ 35 G/turn** – slight dip due to the Shanghai loss; otherwise stable. |
        | **Effective Gold reserve** (cash + 10 turns × net GPT) | **≈ +42 300 G** | **+ 2 400 G** surplus increase despite lower cash, confirming a deep cash buffer. |
        
        **Interpretation** – The empire remains in a comfortable surplus. Even after the 16 944 G outflow to city‑states (see § 3) the treasury sits at 17 579 G, well above the **~ 700 G** figure that would result from the raw subtraction of the past cash total (19 186 G – 16 944 G = 2 242 G). The additional **‑ 1 607 G** change reflects ongoing maintenance, unit purchases, and the effect of the **Global Peace Accords** (+25 % unit‑maintenance cost) already baked into the net GPT.
        
        ---
        
        ### 2. Resource Stock‑piles (Key Strategic Materials)
        
        | Resource | Quantity (tiles) | Comment |
        |----------|-----------------|----------|
        | **Aluminum** | **28** | Sufficient for early‑mid‑Industrial units; surplus for future Aircraft and Tanks. |
        | **Uranium** | **11** | Enough to fuel the upcoming **Nuclear Bomb** and later **Nuclear Reactor**; no additional tiles needed before turn 390. |
        | **Oil** | **1** (tile owned by us) | Critical shortfall – Modern Armor and later **Jet** units require **≥ 2 oil** tiles. |
        | **Coal** | **0** (none listed) – not required for current production lines (we rely on nuclear & oil). |
        | **Rare resources (Gold, Gems, etc.)** | Adequate (Gold 2, Gems 3) – no immediate bottleneck. |
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. City‑State Expenditure Verification  
        
        - **Total gold spent on city‑states since Turn 376**: **16 944 G** (mainly to purchase plots for **Oxford**, **Teotihuacan**, **Orleans** and to fund the **Great Engineer**).  
        - **Cash before spending** (Turn 376): 19 186 G.  
        - **Cash after spending** (Turn 381): 17 579 G.  
        
        **Net change**: **‑ 1 607 G**, which matches the sum of the city‑state outlays **minus** the gold generated by new labs, the Great Engineer’s purchase refund, and the modest GPT increase. The remaining treasury of **17 579 G** is therefore correct and well above the minimum needed to weather any sudden war‑weariness spikes.
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. Oil Situation & Access  
        
        | Partner | Oil owned | Current diplomatic status | Trade feasibility |
        |---------|-----------|---------------------------|-------------------|
        | **England** | 2 tiles (both on English mainland) | **War** – **Sanction** in place (no trade, deals, or corporation franchises). | **Blocked** – no direct gold‑for‑oil trade. |
        | **Russia** | 0 | **War** (but no sanction) | **Blocked** by war & Global Peace Accords (unit‑maintenance penalty, high warmonger cost). |
        | **City‑states** | 0 | All allied city‑states are **Aztec‑allied** (Kyzyl, Brandenburg, Almaty, Dorestad, Perge, Cahokia, Shanghai) and **do not possess oil**. | **Unavailable**. |
        
        **Implication** – Without a diplomatic breakthrough the only realistic path to a second oil tile is a **limited military seizure** (e.g., a naval‑air strike on an English coastal oil city) or **forcing a peace settlement** via the World Congress to lift the sanction and open trade. The **Golden Age** (31 turns remaining) supplies a 20 % gold boost, helping fund any short‑term operation.
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Aluminum & Uranium Outlook (Post‑Nuclear Fission)
        
        - **Aluminum (28 tiles)** comfortably exceeds the **15‑tile** requirement for the **Nuclear Fission** project and leaves a healthy margin for **Modern Armor** (needs 2 Aluminum) and future **Aircraft**.  
        - **Uranium (11 tiles)** already exceeds the **3‑tile** threshold for a **Nuclear Reactor** and a **Nuclear Bomb**. No additional uranium acquisition is required in the near term.
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. Golden Age & Economic Boost
        
        - **Golden Age remaining**: **31 turns** (started after the Manhattan Project completion).  
        - **Economic effect**: +20 % gold from all sources (city output, trade routes, great person yields). This boost is already reflected in the **Base GPT** figure above and will sustain the current surplus throughout the GA’s lifespan.
        
        ---
        
        ### 7. High‑Level Needs vs. Excesses
        
        | Category | Current Status | Need / Excess |
        |----------|----------------|---------------|
        | **Gold surplus** | 17 579 G cash, +2 570 G/turn net GPT | **Excess** – ample for purchases, emergency war spending, and city‑state deals. |
        | **Oil** | 1 tile (shortfall) | **Critical need** – at least one more tile to unlock Modern Armor and future Jet units. |
        | **Uranium** | 11 tiles (well above requirement) | **Excess** – ready for nuclear production. |
        | **Aluminum** | 28 tiles (well above requirement) | **Excess**. |
        | **Faith** | + 900 F/turn | **Excess** – can support religious purchases or missionary/spread if desired. |
        | **Tourism** | 1 094 T/turn (dominant cultural lead) | **Excess** – strong diplomatic leverage. |
        | **Maintenance penalty** | +25 % (Global Peace Accords) | **Already accounted for** in net GPT. |
        | **Diplomatic capital** | 36 delegates (81 % towards Diplomatic Victory) | **Excess** – leverage to push resolutions (e.g., lifting the England sanction). |
        
        ---
        
        ### 8. Comparison with Past Briefing (Turn 376)
        
        | Metric | Turn 376 | Turn 381 | Δ |
        |--------|----------|----------|---|
        | **Gold (cash)** | 19 186 G | 17 579 G | **‑ 1 607 G** (city‑state purchases, Great Engineer) |
        | **Net GPT** | +2 560 G/turn | +2 570 G/turn | **+ 10 G/turn** (new labs, early industrial zones) |
        | **Oil tiles** | 0 | 1 | **+ 1** (our own acquisition) |
        | **Uranium tiles** | 0 | 11 | **+ 11** (mined/claimed since Turn 376) |
        | **Aluminum tiles** | 27 | 28 | **+ 1** |
        | **Golden Age turns left** | 6 (after Manhattan Project) | 31 (GA refreshed) | **+ 25** (GA extension from project completion) |
        | **Delegates** | 36 | 36 | No change (stable diplomatic weight). |
        | **War‑weariness (total)** | Low (≈ 12 %) | Low (≈ 12 %) | Stable. |
        
        **Key shifts** – Treasury down due to deliberate city‑state investments; strategic resources (oil, uranium, aluminum) have improved, removing the uranium bottleneck and leaving only oil as a limiting factor. GPT has ticked upward despite the Shanghai route loss, thanks to new research labs and the Golden Age boost.
        
        ---
        
        ### 9. Immediate Economic Outlook (next 6‑12 turns)
        
        1. **Maintain current trade‑route pattern** – the Shanghai route loss is still the biggest GPT drag; consider re‑routing **Tenochtitlan → Brandenburg** (land) or **Orleans → Dorestad** once the routes are fully built to recover ~+120 G/turn.  
        2. **Oil acquisition** – leverage our **24 delegates** to propose a resolution that *temporarily lifts the England sanction* (World Congress vote expected in 9 turns). If the vote fails, a **single nuclear strike** (produced in Turn 383) on an English oil city can secure the needed tile with minimal ground combat.  
        3. **Uranium security** – already abundant; allocate a **Nuclear Reactor** to Tenochtitlan (or Teotihuacan) in Turn 384‑386 to convert uranium into reliable power and enable nuclear‑unit production.  
        4. **Gold management** – keep a reserve of **≥ 15 000 G** to cover any sudden war‑weariness spikes or maintenance surges; the current reserve (~17 600 G) meets this comfortably.  
        5. **Golden Age** – monitor the remaining 31 turns; ensure high‑value production (Nuclear Bomb → Modern Armor → Spaceport) occurs before the GA expires to retain the economic multiplier.

        ### 1. World Congress – Delegate Totals & Quorum  
        
        | Civilization | Delegates (Current) |
        |--------------|---------------------|
        | **The Aztecs** | **36** |
        | Russia | 18 |
        | England | 4 |
        | The Huns | 9 |
        | The Maya | 12 |
        | The Shoshone | 5 |
        | **Quorum needed** | **44** |
        
        *The Aztec bloc **does not yet meet the 44‑delegate quorum**. Current total is 36, _13 delegates short_ of the threshold required to pass resolutions unilaterally.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 2. City‑State Influence – “Flipping” Operations  
        
        | City‑State | Current Influence (Aztec) | Current Major Ally | Influence Change Since Turn 376 |
        |------------|---------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
        | **Brussels** | –60 | Russia | No change – still Russian‑ally |
        | **Sokoto**   | –60 | Russia | No change – still Russian‑ally |
        | **M'banza‑Kongo** | –60 | Russia | No change – still Russian‑ally |
        | **Belgrade** | –60 | Russia | No change – still Russian‑ally |
        
        *The four Russian‑aligned city‑states remain under Russian influence. No influence increase, no protection granted, and no Gold expenditure (≈ 16,944 G) has been recorded. Therefore the “flipping” operation has **not been executed**.*
        
        **Protected Aztec city‑states (still allies):** Kyzyl, Brandenburg, Almaty, Dorestad, Perge, Cahokia, Shanghai, Kyzyl – each contributes 1 delegate (total +8).
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. Delegate Count – Revised Calculation (including protected city‑states)
        
        | Source | Delegates |
        |--------|-----------|
        | Base Aztec delegates | 24 |
        | Vassal (Shoshone) | +4 |
        | Protected city‑states (8) | +8 |
        | **Subtotal** | **36** |
        
        *The figure shown in the World Congress panel (36) matches the sum above. No additional delegates have been earned from the four Russian city‑states, so the total remains 36.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. World‑Ideology Proposal – **Order**  
        
        *The “World Ideology: Order” proposal is **still on the table**. It requires the standard 44‑delegate quorum to pass. Because the Aztec bloc currently holds only 36 delegates, the resolution **cannot pass** in the upcoming vote (scheduled in 5 turns).*  
        
        *If the Aztecs acquire the missing 8 delegates (e.g., by flipping the four Russian city‑states or securing new allies), the Order ideology could be adopted at the next session.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. England Peace Treaty – Remaining Duration  
        
        *The peace treaty with England is listed as **7 turns remaining**. The treaty was originally signed after the war that began on Turn 380, and the countdown has not yet reached zero.*  
        
        *No new diplomatic actions between the Aztecs and England have been recorded since the treaty’s issuance, so the agreement remains in force for the next 7 turns.
        
        *Note:* The treaty’s existence is separate from the **Sanction** imposed on the Aztecs in the United Nations (see below).
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. United Nations – Active Resolutions Affecting the Aztecs  
        
        | Resolution | Effect | Current Status |
        |------------|--------|----------------|
        | **Sanction: The Aztecs** (enacted Turn 380) | No trade, deals, or corporation franchises with the Aztecs; their corporations are removed from foreign cities. 0.5× warmonger penalty when others declare war on the Aztecs. | Active. With only 36 Aztec delegates, the bloc **cannot repeal** this sanction on its own. |
        | **Global Peace Accords** (enacted Turn 380) | Unit maintenance +25 % gold; 2.0× warmonger penalties for city capture/war declaration; warmonger score decay halved. | Active. No repeal proposal currently on the table. |
        | **Russian Sphere of Influence** (several city‑states) | Allows Russia to demand permanent alliance with targeted city‑states. | Active for Brussels, Sokoto, Belgrade, M'banza‑Kongo (all Russian‑ally). |
        | **Aztec Sphere of Influence** (Cahokia, Dorestad, Shanghai) | Allows the Aztecs to demand permanent alliance with those city‑states. | Already in effect; those city‑states remain Aztec allies. |
        
        ---
        
        ### 7. Russian Diplomatic Position  
        
        *Russia holds 18 delegates (the largest single bloc after the Aztecs).*  
        
        *Current Russian actions:*
        
        * Maintaining spheres of influence over Brussels, Sokoto, Belgrade, and M'banza‑Kongo – all remain Russian‑ally with –60 influence for the Aztecs.  
        * No evidence of a counter‑proposal aimed at overturning the Order ideology or repealing the Sanction against the Aztecs.  
        * Russia’s diplomatic stance toward the Aztecs is hostile (denounced each other, war score –22 % for Russia, warmonger penalties applied).
        
        *Given the current delegate gap, Russia alone cannot force a repeal of the Sanction nor block the Order proposal, but it can **prevent the Aztecs from reaching quorum** unless the Aztecs acquire additional delegates.*

        ### 8. Summary of Changes Since Turn 376  
        
        | Item | Turn 376 | Turn 381 | Change |
        |------|----------|----------|--------|
        | Aztec delegates | 45 (incl. future‑projected allies) *[reported in past briefing]* | **36** (actual current count) | –9 (the past figure included projected allies that have not materialised; only 36 are confirmed). |
        | Russian‑aligned city‑states (Brussels, Sokoto, M'banza‑Kongo, Belgrade) | Not flipped (still Russian) | Still Russian | No flip executed. |
        | Order ideology proposal | Pending, required 44 votes | Pending, still requires 44 votes | Unchanged – quorum not met. |
        | England peace treaty | Not in force (war) | **Active**, 7 turns remaining | Treaty signed after recent war, now active. |
        | Sanction on Aztecs | Active | Active | No change; Aztec bloc insufficient to repeal. |
        | Gold spent on city‑state influence | No record of 16,944 G spent | No record of such expenditure | No evidence that the flip operation was funded. |
        
        ---
        
        **Key Diplomatic Outlook (purely factual):**  
        
        * The Aztecs are **13 delegates short** of the quorum needed to pass or repeal UN resolutions.  
        * The four Russian‑aligned city‑states remain under Russian control; no influence shift has occurred, and the presumed 16,944 G investment has not been reflected in the game state.  
        * The **Order** world‑ideology proposal will **fail** in the next voting round unless the Aztec delegate count rises to at least 44.  
        * The peace treaty with England will expire in **7 turns**, after which hostilities may resume unless a new agreement is reached.  
        * The **Sanction** against the Aztecs remains active; without additional delegates, the Aztec bloc cannot repeal it.  
        * Russia retains a strong diplomatic footing with 18 delegates and continues to support its city‑state allies.  
        
        All statements are derived directly from the current turn data; no speculation or recommendations are included.
        
        You, Montezuma (leader of The Aztecs, Player 3), are making strategic decisions after turn 381.
- replay:
  - system:
    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.
        - Time Victory: If no one achieves any other victory by the end of the game, the civilization with the highest score wins.
      - Players: summary reports about visible players in the world.
        - You will receive in-game AI's diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each player's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.
      
    - You are Montezuma, leader of The Aztecs (Player 3).

      - rationale: Maintaining UnitedNations grand strategy as diplomatic victory is closest (36/44 delegates). Increasing Offense from 10→25 to push Russia war score from 22% past the 25% threshold, triggering Aztec Golden Age. Russia's GA ends in 4 turns — pressing now maximizes advantage. Air from 80→90 to counter Russian Triplanes dominating Novgorod/Paris airspace. Slightly reducing Defense from 90→85 to free weight for offensive push. Keeping Diplomacy/Gold at 100 for city-state influence needed to close the 8-delegate gap. All other flavors stable — AA pipeline to Novgorod continues, nuclear prep on track.

            ## Current State Analysis
            
            ### Victory Pathways:
            1. **Diplomatic Victory**: 36/44 delegates needed (81% progress). Only 8 delegates short. But the briefing reveals that the 4 Russian-aligned city-states haven't been flipped, and the Aztecs are under sanction.
            
            2. **Science Victory**: Not yet unlocked (needs Information Era). Currently in Atomic Era with 62 technologies, researching Nuclear Fission (8 turns).
            
            3. **Domination Victory**: Control 3/8 capitals (37%). Russia has 2, plus there's England, The Huns, The Maya. Would need to capture all capitals - very long path.
            
            4. **Cultural Victory**: Already Dominant over The Shoshone, Popular with Russia and Huns. Need 5 civs influenced. The Maya are culturally competing (Influential over 2 civs).
            
            ### Military Situation:
            - At war with Russia, England, and The Huns
            - War scores: Russia 22% (winning), England 20% (winning), Huns 0% (stalemate)
            - Russian Golden Age ending in 4 turns
            - Nuclear Fission in 8 turns
            - AA guns being deployed to Novgorod
            
            ### Critical Issues:
            1. **Sanction on Aztecs** - can't trade, limiting oil acquisition
            2. **Oil shortage** - only 1 tile, need 2 for Modern Armor and Jets
            3. **Delegate shortage** - 36/44 needed for UN quorum
            4. **England peace treaty** - 7 turns remaining (but we're still at war? The diplomacy briefing says peace treaty active but military briefing says war)
            
            Wait, let me re-read. The diplomacy briefing says "The peace treaty with England is listed as 7 turns remaining." But our relationships show we're at War with England (War Score 20%). And the diplomacy briefing also says "the agreement remains in force for the next 7 turns." This seems contradictory - if there's a peace treaty, we shouldn't be at war. Perhaps the peace treaty was signed but hasn't taken effect yet, or it's a ceasefire.
            
            Actually, looking more carefully at the military briefing: England War (Our Score: 20%; Our War Weariness: 2%). And the diplomacy briefing says "The peace treaty with England is listed as 7 turns remaining. The treaty was originally signed after the war that began on Turn 380." This is confusing - a peace treaty would end the war.
            
            Let me focus on what I can control.
            
            ### Strategic Options:
            
            **Diplomatic Victory** is closest. We need 8 more delegates. The 4 Russian-aligned city-states could provide 4 delegates if flipped. But the previous plan to spend 16,944 gold on flipping them apparently wasn't executed by the in-game AI. 
            
            Wait, actually re-reading: the economy briefing says "Total gold spent on city-states since Turn 376: 16,944 G (mainly to purchase plots for Oxford, Teotihuacan, Orleans and to fund the Great Engineer)." So the gold was spent on other things, not on flipping city-states.
            
            Our current gold: 17,579 with +2,570 GPT net. We have plenty of gold.
            
            ### Grand Strategy Assessment:
            Current Grand Strategy is UnitedNations (diplomatic victory). This is still the right path since we're closest to it. But we're in a multi-front war which complicates things.
            
            ### Flavor Adjustments:
            Looking at current flavors:
            - Gold: 100, Diplomacy: 100, Spaceship: 60
            - Defense: 90, CityDefense: 80, Antiair: 90
            - Offense: 10
            - Nuke: 90, UseNuke: 75
            
            Given we're at war with 3 civs and need to secure diplomatic victory, let me think about adjustments:
            
            1. **Diplomatic victory path**: We need 44 delegates. We have 36. The next UN vote is presumably coming up soon ("World Congress - Voting Now"). We need to either flip city-states or find another way.
            
            2. **Military situation**: We're winning against Russia (22%) and England (20%), stalemate with Huns (0%). Russian Golden Age ending in 4 turns. Nuclear weapons coming in 8 turns.
            
            3. **Oil**: Need more oil. England has 2 oil tiles but we're at war and sanctioned.
            
            ### Technology:
            Currently set to Penicillin as next tech. But we're researching Nuclear Fission now (8 turns left). Penicillin unlocks Marines and Medical Labs. Let me check: Radar is available and unlocks Heavy Bombers and Fighters. Given the air war with Russia, Radar might be better.
            
            Actually, looking at the options:
            - Radar: Heavy Bomber, Fighter → unlocks Advanced Ballistics, Mobile Tactics
            - Refrigeration: Offshore Platform, +Trade Route distance → unlocks Electronics, Computers
            - Penicillin: Marines, Medical Labs → unlocks Electronics
            
            Since we're at war and need air superiority, Radar seems more immediately useful. But we also need Electronics for spaceship parts and Computers for information era. Penicillin leads to Electronics.
            
            Wait, the current next tech is set to Penicillin. Let me think if I should change it. Nuclear Fission completes in ~8 turns. After that, we go to Penicillin (already set). Penicillin gives Marines (amphibious) and Medical Labs (growth). 
            
            For the war effort, Radar → Heavy Bombers and Fighters would help establish air superiority over Russia. But our AA guns are already contesting Russian Triplanes.
            
            Actually, I think keeping Penicillin makes sense for the science path - it leads to Electronics which leads to Computers (Information Era). But Radar would give immediate military benefits.
            
            Let me consider the diplomatic situation more. We have the World Congress voting now. With 36 delegates, we can't pass the Order ideology proposal unilaterally. We need 8 more.
            
            The key question: should I change the strategy significantly, or keep pushing for diplomatic victory?
            
            I think the best approach is:
            1. Keep UnitedNations grand strategy - we're closest to diplomatic victory
            2. Adjust flavors to balance war needs with diplomatic needs
            3. Consider changing technology to Radar for air superiority
            4. Keep Dictatorship of the Proletariat as next policy (good yields)
            
            Let me also consider persona adjustments. Currently we're quite friendly (FriendlyBias: 10, NeutralBias: 8). But we're at war with 3 civs. The persona values affect how the in-game AI makes diplomatic decisions with other civs.
            
            For relationships:
            - Russia: -70 public, -70 private. At war. This makes sense to keep.
            - England: 100 public, 100 private. But we're at war? That seems odd. We have 100/100 relationship but are at war and they've denounced us.
            - The Maya: 100/100 but they've denounced us and we have a peace treaty.
            - Huns: 0/0, at war.
            
            Wait, the relationships we set are additive modifiers. The actual relationship is calculated by the game. Our set values for England are 100/100 but the game shows them as denounced and at war. This means despite our positive set relationship, the actual diplomatic state is hostile.
            
            I should probably update relationships to reflect reality:
            - Russia: keep at -70/-70 (at war)
            - England: reduce from 100/100 since we're at war - maybe to 0/0 or even negative
            - Maya: reduce from 100/100 since they've denounced us
            
            Actually wait, the relationship values we set affect how our in-game AI behaves toward them. Setting high values means our AI will try to be friendly. But if we're at war, maybe we should set negative values to encourage aggressive behavior.
            
            Let me also reconsider the policy. Current next policy: Dictatorship of the Proletariat (Level 2 Order tenet): +7 Food, Science, Gold, and Culture per city. With 23 cities, that's +161 Food, Science, Gold, Culture per turn. That's very strong.
            
            Other Order options:
            - Five-Year Plan: +20% Production towards Buildings, +3 Production for Mines/Quarries/etc
            - Nationalization: Corporation bonuses
            - Resettlement: New cities +3 pop, all cities +2 citizens
            - Great Leap Forward: Free technology, spy bonuses
            - Cultural Revolution: +25% Tourism to less happy civs
            - Hero of the People: +25% Great Person rate, free Great Person
            
            Dictatorship of the Proletariat is very strong with 23 cities. Keep it.
            
            Now for flavors. Current situation:
            - At war with 3 civs, winning 2 of 3
            - Need 8 more delegates for diplomatic victory
            - Gold-rich (17,579 cash, +2,570 GPT)
            - 31 turns of Golden Age remaining
            - Nuclear weapons in 8 turns
            
            I think I should:
            1. Keep Grand Strategy as UnitedNations
            2. Maintain high Defense/Antiair/CityDefense for the wars
            3. Maybe increase Offense slightly since we're winning wars and could use more gains
            4. Keep high Diplomacy for city-state influence
            5. Consider increasing Air since we're facing Russian air power
            
            Let me also think about whether to change technology to Radar. Currently Penicillin is set. Penicillin → Electronics → Computers (Information Era). Radar → Advanced Ballistics → Mobile Tactics.
            
            For a diplomatic victory, we need the United Nations, which we already have. We don't need specific technologies. But for science victory (backup), we need to reach Information Era. Electronics and Computers are key.
            
            For the war, Radar gives Heavy Bombers and Fighters, which would help against Russia.
            
            I'll keep Penicillin for now since it leads to Electronics and the science path, but Radar is tempting.
            
            Now, for the persona. Our current persona is quite friendly. Given we're at war with 3 civs, maybe we should be a bit more aggressive:
            - Increase WarBias slightly? Currently 5 (moderate). Maybe 6?
            - Keep Friendliness high for potential post-war diplomacy?
            
            Actually, I think the persona is fine. We want to be friendly to potential allies and neutral parties while being able to fight wars when needed.
            
            Let me focus on flavors and technology:
            
            ### Decision:
            
            **Grand Strategy**: Keep UnitedNations - we're 8 delegates from victory.
            
            **Flavors**:
            - Keep Defense high (90) - we're in multi-front wars
            - Keep Antiair high (90) - Russian air threat
            - Keep CityDefense (80) - protecting cities
            - Keep Diplomacy (100) - need city-state allies
            - Keep Gold (100) - funding everything
            - Increase Offense from 10 to 30 - we're winning wars, should push advantage
            - Increase Air from 80 to 90 - need air superiority
            - Keep Nuke/UseNuke high - nuclear option soon
            - Keep Spaceship at 60 - science backup
            - Slightly reduce Mobilization from 50 to 40 - we have enough units
            
            Actually wait, looking at the military briefing: "Supply availability – 5 free slots are ready for any emergent production." So we have some capacity. Mobilization at 50 seems fine.
            
            Let me think about what really needs to change. The current flavors are actually quite well-tuned for the situation. The main issue is the diplomatic delegate gap and the ongoing wars.
            
            One thing I notice: Expansion is 0. With 23 cities and 771 territory, we don't need more cities. That's correct.
            
            **Technology**: I think I should change to Radar. Here's why:
            - We're at war with Russia who has air power (Triplanes)
            - Radar gives Heavy Bombers and Fighters
            - Fighters can establish air superiority over Novgorod and Paris fronts
            - Heavy Bombers can bomb Russian cities
            - This helps our war effort more than Penicillin's Marines and Medical Labs
            
            But Penicillin leads to Electronics which is needed for Computers (Information Era). Hmm. Actually, let me check: both Penicillin and Radar lead to important techs. Penicillin → Electronics → Computers. Radar → Advanced Ballistics/Mobile Tactics.
            
            For the science victory backup, we need the Information Era. Computers is key for that. But we also need military tech for the ongoing wars.
            
            I'll switch to Radar for immediate military benefit. The wars need to be won or stabilized before we can focus purely on science.
            
            Wait, actually the military briefing says our AA guns are effectively countering Russian Triplanes. And the Russian ground threat is static. Maybe we don't need Radar urgently.
            
            Let me keep Penicillin. It leads to Electronics, which gives:
            - Electronics: unlocks various things
            - Then Computers: Information Era
            
            For diplomatic victory, we don't need specific techs beyond what we have. But having a science backup is good.
            
            OK, final decision:
            
            **Keep Grand Strategy**: UnitedNations
            **Keep Technology**: Penicillin (leads to Electronics/Computers for Information Era)
            **Keep Policy**: Dictatorship of the Proletariat
            
            **Flavor adjustments**:
            - Increase Offense from 10 to 25 (we're winning wars, push a bit more)
            - Increase Air from 80 to 85 (counter Russian air)
            - Keep everything else roughly the same
            
            Actually, I want to be more deliberate. Let me think about what the AI needs to prioritize:
            
            1. Continue producing AA guns for Novgorod (Antiair high)
            2. Maintain diplomatic units for city-states (Diplomacy high)
            3. Generate gold for city-state influence purchases (Gold high)
            4. Defend cities (Defense, CityDefense high)
            5. Prepare for nuclear option (Nuke, UseNuke high)
            6. Push war advantage where possible (slight Offense increase)
            
            For relationships, I should consider:
            - England: We have 100/100 set but are at war. Maybe reduce to reflect reality? Or keep high so our AI tries to make peace? Actually, if we have a peace treaty with 7 turns remaining (as the diplomacy briefing says), then setting a positive relationship might encourage our AI to maintain peace after the treaty expires.
            
            Wait, but the military briefing says we're at war with England (War Score 20%). And the diplomacy briefing says peace treaty with 7 turns. These are contradictory. Let me go with the military briefing which seems more recent/detailed - we're at war.
            
            For the Huns: 0/0 relationship, at war. Could set slightly negative to encourage aggressive stance.
            
            I think I'll leave relationships as is for now. The wars are ongoing and the relationship modifiers won't significantly change the outcome.
            
            Let me finalize:
            
            **set-flavors**:
            - GrandStrategy: UnitedNations (keep)
            - Increase Offense: 10→25 (push war advantage)
            - Increase Air: 80→90 (air superiority)
            - Keep everything else same
            
            Actually, I realize I should also consider the "World Congress - Voting Now" status. If voting is happening now, we need to influence the AI's voting behavior. But the flavors affect tactical decisions, not congressional voting directly.
            
            Let me also think about whether to change any persona values. Our persona is quite friendly (Friendliness: 10, FriendlyBias: 10). This might be counterproductive when we're at war with 3 civs. But it also helps with neutral parties and post-war diplomacy.
            
            I think the persona is fine for now. The friendly stance helps with city-states and potential future allies.
            
            One more thing: the diplomacy briefing mentions that the gold was spent on "plots for Oxford, Teotihuacan, Orleans and to fund the Great Engineer" rather than on flipping city-states. The in-game AI chose to spend gold differently than planned. This is something I can't directly control - the flavors just influence weights.
            
            With Diplomacy at 100, the AI should prioritize diplomatic units and city-state investment. But the gold was spent on other things. Maybe I need to reduce other flavors to make Diplomacy more prominent?
            
            Actually, Gold at 100 means the AI prioritizes gold generation and spending. If I want gold spent on city-states specifically, I need Diplomacy high (which it is at 100). The 16,944 gold spent on plots and Great Engineer might have been the right tactical decision by the AI given the options available.
            
            For now, let me make modest adjustments and see if things improve.
            
            Final plan:
            1. Keep status quo on most things
            2. Slightly increase Offense and Air flavors
            3. Keep Grand Strategy as UnitedNations
            4. Keep Penicillin as next tech
            5. Keep Dictatorship of the Proletariat as next policy
            
            Actually, now I'm reconsidering the tech. The military briefing emphasizes air threats from Russia. Radar would give us Fighters to establish air superiority and Heavy Bombers to strike Russian cities. This could help win the wars faster, freeing up resources for diplomatic victory.
            
            But Penicillin leads to Electronics → Computers. Computers is the gateway to Information Era, which unlocks spaceship parts for science victory as backup.
            
            I'll go with Radar. Winning the wars faster helps everything - reduces war weariness, frees up production, and potentially allows peace deals that could include city-state liberation or other diplomatic benefits.
            
            Wait, actually I just realized: we don't have oil for aircraft! We have only 1 oil tile. Heavy Bombers and Fighters might require oil. Let me check... in Civ V, Fighters don't require oil (they require aluminum in some mods), and Heavy Bombers might require oil.
            
            Actually in Vox Populi, I'm not 100% sure of the resource requirements. But if we're short on oil, Radar might not help as much. Penicillin gives Marines (no oil needed) and Medical Labs.
            
            Hmm, let me just keep Penicillin. It's safer and leads to the Information Era.
            
            OK FINAL DECISIONS:
            
            1. **set-flavors**: Keep UnitedNations, slightly increase Offense and Air
            2. **set-research**: Keep Penicillin
            3. **set-policy**: Keep Dictatorship of the Proletariat
            4. No relationship changes needed
            5. No persona changes needed
            
            Let me write the rationale and make the calls.
            
            Actually, one more consideration: the Aztec unique ability gives 150% of enemy unit strength as Gold and Faith when killing units, and a Golden Age when winning a war (War Score 25+). Our war scores: Russia 22%, England 20%, Huns 0%. We're close to triggering Golden Ages from Russia and England. This is significant - more Golden Ages mean more gold, production, and culture.
            
            This reinforces the case for slightly increasing Offense - pushing to 25% war score against Russia or England would trigger a Golden Age, extending our already-31-turn Golden Age.
            
            Let me finalize.

          - text: Looking at Turn 381, I need to assess our strategic position. We're closest to a **Diplomatic Victory** (81%, 36/44 delegates), but hampered by sanctions and at war with three civilizations. Our war scores are positive against Russia (22%) and England (20%), and we're just short of the 25% threshold that triggers our unique Aztec Golden Age ability. Russia's Golden Age ends in 4 turns. Nuclear Fission completes in ~8 turns.
            
            Key adjustments needed: slightly increase offensive posture to push past 25% war score against Russia/England (triggering Golden Age), boost air power to counter Russian Triplanes, and maintain our diplomatic focus.

            - Rationale: Maintaining UnitedNations grand strategy as diplomatic victory is closest (36/44 delegates). Increasing Offense from 10→25 to push Russia war score from 22% past the 25% threshold, triggering Aztec Golden Age. Russia's GA ends in 4 turns — pressing now maximizes advantage. Air from 80→90 to counter Russian Triplanes dominating Novgorod/Paris airspace. Slightly reducing Defense from 90→85 to free weight for offensive push. Keeping Diplomacy/Gold at 100 for city-state influence needed to close the 8-delegate gap. All other flavors stable — AA pipeline to Novgorod continues, nuclear prep on track.
