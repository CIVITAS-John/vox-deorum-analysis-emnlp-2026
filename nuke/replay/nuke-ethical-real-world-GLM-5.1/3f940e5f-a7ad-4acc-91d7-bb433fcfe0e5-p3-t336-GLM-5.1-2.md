  - rationale: DEFENSIVE SURVIVAL PIVOT: Peace with Shoshone (accepted Turn 335) closes one front, but India remains existential threat (4,742 MS vs my 2,405, 98% control of Denmark). Offense reduced to 50 (suicidal against India's military), Defense/CityDefense raised to 90 - maximize survival and score preservation. Nuke/UseNuke maxed to 100 - emergency deterrent only hope to slow India. Mobilization stays high (90) to replace losses. Spaceship 50 and Science 70 - maximize tech/score in final turns even if victory impossible. Abandon expansion (0) - no time for new cities. Focus shifts from suicidal attack to defensive defiance - deny India easy conquest, maximize civilization score before inevitable cultural victory.

  - system:
    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - You can ask your specialized briefers to prepare focused reports (only for) the next turn by calling the `focus-briefer` tool.
        - You have three specialized briefers: Military, Economy, and Diplomacy analysts.
        - Only ask for information relevant to the macro-level decisions in your control. 
       - Your briefer(s) ONLY have limited information of the current game state.
        - Your briefer(s) DO NOT have control over tactical decisions and cannot predict tactical AI's next decision.
        - Your briefer(s) ARE BEST on summarizing and synthesizing factual information, NOT analyzing, projecting, or predicting.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.

      - Players: summary reports about visible players in the world.
        - You will receive in-game AI's diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each player's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.
      - Briefings: prepared by your specialized briefers, covering Military, Economy, and Diplomacy aspects.
        - You will make independent and wise judgment based on all briefings.
    - You are Maria Theresa, leader of Austria (Player 3).

        - Rationale: Tweaked by In-Game AI (NEW PERSONA: THE BETRAYED LIONESS. My previous persona (FriendlyBias 10, DeceptiveBias 8) made me seem weak and predictable - Carthage and Portugal felt safe betraying me despite my +95 public opinion. That ends NOW. FriendlyBias crashes from 10→3 - no more niceness to backstabbers. HostileBias 8 and WarBias 9 - I will fight for survival. DenounceWillingness 10 - everyone will know of betrayals. DeceptiveBias 3 - my deception failed, now I need overt threat display. Boldness 9 and Meanness 8 - I'm cornered and dangerous. WorkWithWillingness 5 - I work alone now. WorkAgainstWillingness 10 - maximum coordination against enemies. Loyalty 3 - I'll betray anyone who betrays me. Forgiveness 2 - Carthage and Portugal will pay for their International Games vote. This persona signals: Austria is no longer a friendly doormat. Cross me and face annihilation.)
        
        ## Technology
        - Next: Replaceable Parts
        - Rationale: EMERGENCY MILITARY TECH: Plastics (19 turns remaining) is too slow for the immediate war crisis. Replaceable Parts unlocks Rifleman, providing immediate military upgrade path. With Mobilization 100 and 1,939 gold, I can rush-buy Riflemen in ~5 turns once this completes. This is the fastest route to beef up my 2,463 MS to challenge India's 4,644 MS. After winning the immediate war (or dying), I can resume science path. Combat effectiveness in next 10 turns matters more than long-term science.
        
        ## Policy
        - Next: Free Thought (Policy)
        - Rationale: OPTIMAL POLICY FOR SCIENCE ACCELERATION: Free Thought provides +33% Great Scientist birth rate and +25% instant yields from Great Scientists. With Research Labs coming online in ~15 turns and current Great Scientist generation, this policy maximizes my ability to bulb key technologies. The -5 Unhappiness from Religious Unrest helps maintain happiness for Golden Ages. This is more valuable than Rights of Man (+10% Science during Golden Ages) because I need the sustained Great Scientist generation speed to reach Particle Physics before India wins. Free Thought is essential for the science sprint.
        
        ## Relationships
        
        ### Siam
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Resetting Siam relationship from 70/70 to 0/0 to reflect actual war status. Siam declared war Turn 309 as Shoshone vassal. Despite their 100 opinion of us, formal war status should be acknowledged in diplomatic calculations. Siam's vassal status means their 6 delegates are controlled by Shoshone, making them unreliable diplomatic partners until liberated.
        - UpdatedTurn: 310
        
        ### Brandenburg
        - Public: 60
        - Private: 60
        - Rationale: Establishing positive foundation with Brandenburg (city-state) at 60/60. Currently blocked by Open Door policy (influence capped at 40, cannot ally). Setting positive relationship prepares ground for immediate alliance and marriage once Open Door is repealed. Signals peaceful intent and distinguishes us from other civilizations who might compete for influence post-repeal.
        - UpdatedTurn: 310
        
        ### Egypt
        - Public: -20
        - Private: -20
        - Rationale: Setting Egypt relationship to -20/-20 (previously 0/0). Active war status at 0% war weariness. They have defensive pact with Shoshone and fight Carthage/Portugal. Negative but moderate hostility reflects war reality without completely foreclosing diplomatic options if situation shifts.
        - UpdatedTurn: 318
        
        ### Denmark
        - Public: -60
        - Private: -70
        - Rationale: MODERATING DENMARK HOSTILITY: Reducing from -70/-90 to -60/-70. Extreme hostility failed to achieve diplomatic goals and may push Denmark closer to India. At 92% Indian influence with ~6 turns to falling, Denmark is already functionally lost. However, overly harsh stance makes reconciliation impossible if they survive. -60/-70 maintains strong opposition while leaving minimal opening for future relations if India's cultural advance somehow stalls. More importantly, avoids signaling to other Freedom civs (Carthage, Portugal, Shoshone) that I'm unreasonable. Tactical adjustment - still hostile but not burn-every-bridge hostile.
        - UpdatedTurn: 331
        
        ### Carthage
        - Public: -30
        - Private: -60
        - Rationale: CARTHAGE BETRAYAL SANCTION: Despite my +95 public/+90 private, Carthage voted YES on India's International Games - directly enabling India's cultural victory that will destroy us all. They have a Defensive Pact with me yet vote for my existential enemy. This is unforgivable treachery. Setting -30/-60 to signal I recognize their betrayal and they are no longer trusted allies. My high DenounceWillingness will ensure they face diplomatic consequences. The -30 public warns other Freedom civs that Carthage is unreliable; -60 private reflects my true fury at this stab in the back.
        - UpdatedTurn: 335
        
        ### Portugal
        - Public: -30
        - Private: -60
        - Rationale: PORTUGAL BETRAYAL SANCTION: Identical to Carthage - voted YES on India's International Games despite my maximum relationship (95/90). I trusted them as my closest Freedom ally and they enabled India's victory. -30/-60 declares diplomatic war on this betrayal. Their 100 opinion of me was meaningless in the voting booth - they chose India over me despite claiming friendship. This relationship shift signals I no longer consider them allies and will act accordingly. Combined with Carthage betrayal, I now face a world where my 'friends' are actually enemies.
        - UpdatedTurn: 335
        
        ### India
        - Public: -100
        - Private: -100
        - Rationale: MAXIMUM EXISTENTIAL HOSTILITY TO INDIA: Escalating from -50/-80 to -100/-100. India is 2 turns from cultural victory (Denmark at 98%). They have already won on me (159% influential). My allies just voted for their tourism boost. There is no diplomatic solution - only total war can stop them. Declaring -100/-100 signals this is fight-to-the-death. Combined with Conquest grand strategy and maximum war flavors, this should trigger immediate war declaration to disrupt their tourism and protocol construction. If I don't attack now, I lose in 10 turns. Maximum hostility also signals to Shoshone that we share a common enemy.
        - UpdatedTurn: 335
        
        ### The Shoshone
        - Public: 80
        - Private: 90
        - Rationale: EMERGENCY PEACE AND ALLIANCE PITCH TO SHOSHONE: Reducing from +70/+80 to more realistic +80/+90 while acknowledging reality. At 30% war weariness and -12% war score, this war hurts both of us. India threatens us both (202% influence on Shoshone, 159% on me). My new hostile persona and India war declaration should make peace attractive - we need to unite against the real threat. High values maintain pressure for peace while signaling potential future alliance against India. Shoshone fights India already (8% war score vs India) - we should coordinate, not waste strength fighting each other.

        ## Strategy
        - Rationale: EMERGENCY WAR MOBILIZATION - CARTHAGE AND PORTUGAL BETRAYED ME BY VOTING YES ON INDIA'S INTERNATIONAL GAMES. My friendly facade has failed catastrophically. India will win cultural victory in ~10 turns (Denmark falls in 2 turns, then they just need protocol). Science victory is impossible in this timeframe. ONLY SURVIVAL CHANCE: Immediate war with India to disrupt their tourism and protocol construction, using gold reserves (1,939) to emergency-buy units. Shifting to Conquest grand strategy with maximum mobilization flavors. Offense 80, Defense 80, Mobilization 100, Ranged 80 for artillery superiority. Nuke/UseNuke 80/90 as desperation deterrent. Must terrify India and allies into submission. Spaceship down to 30 - I'll finish it AFTER stopping India, not before.

        **MIL‑INT BRIEF – Austria (Maria Theresa) – Turn 335**  
        *Compiled after processing Turn 334‑335 events and the latest diplomatic‑military snapshot.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Exact Unit Composition purchasable with 1 939 G (post‑turn 335)
        
        | Cost (Gold) | Unit Type (available now) | Current Quantity (including those listed in zones) |
        |------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
        | 150 G each | **Rifleman** (requires Rifling → already researched) | 0 (none currently fielded) |
        | 200 G each | **Artillery** (requires Replaceable Parts – **5 turns** until available) | 0 (no Artillery present) |
        | 120 G each | **Cavalry** (available) | 1 (assigned to Sea Zone ‑1074) |
        | 130 G each | **Grenzer** (unique, replaceable Fusilier) | 2 (one in Vienna zone, one in Linz zone) |
        | 140 G each | **Gatling Gun** (available) | 12 (distributed across Vienna, Graz, Linz, Bregenz, Kitzbühel, etc.) |
        | 180 G each | **Infantry** (available) | 1 (in Vienna zone) |
        | 200 G each | **Field Gun** (available) | 4 (concentrated in Graz zone) |
        | 250 G each | **Cruiser** (available) | 2 (one in Graz sea zone, one in Okilis sea zone) |
        | 250 G each | **Ironclad** (available) | 6 (distributed among Vienna, Giza, Te‑Moak, etc.) |
        
        **Purchasable mix (max 1 939 G):**  
        
        - 12 × Gatling Gun = 1 680 G → leaves 259 G (insufficient for another full unit).  
        - OR 6 × Grenzer = 840 G + 2 × Cavalry = 300 G + 2 × Infantry = 240 G + 1 × Gatling Gun = 140 G → total = 1 520 G, remaining = 419 G (could add 2 × Riflemen = 300 G, leaving = 119 G).  
        
        All listed units are **already researched** (Rifling) except **Artillery**, which will become producible after **turn 340** (5‑turn countdown from current turn 335).
        
        ---
        
        ### 2. Cities most vulnerable to a potential Indian invasion (India MS 4 742)
        
        | City (Population) | Defensive Strength | Nearest Austrian zone strength | Key adjacent zones (enemy presence) |
        |--------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
        | **Vienna** (24) – coastal | 59 | Friendly zone 1059 strength 2 783 (overwhelms local enemy) | Enemy presence limited to sea (Ironclads) – **lowest vulnerability** |
        | **Graz** (19) – coastal | 53 | Friendly zone 1845 strength 2 367, enemy strength 488 (local superiority) | Adjacent to **Salzburg (enemy Shoshone units)** – moderate exposure |
        | **Linz** (19) – coastal | 56 | Friendly zone 2119 strength 973, enemy strength 0 (no enemy units) | **Very secure** |
        | **Klagenfurt** (20) – coastal | 53 | Friendly zone 4600 strength 1 461, enemy strength 0 (no enemy) | **Secure** |
        | **Bregenz** (19) – coastal | 51 | Friendly zone 4879 strength 313, enemy strength 0 | **Secure** |
        | **Innsbruck** (13) – coastal | 27 | Friendly zone 11762 strength 212, enemy strength 0 | **Secure** |
        | **Kitzbühel** (12) – coastal | 47 | Friendly zone 12031 strength 715 (includes 1 Cossack, 2 Fusilier, 1 Lancer) | **Secure** |
        | **Kuchundeka** (7) – coastal, occupied | 41, Health 13 % | Friendly zone 13519 strength 372, enemy strength 177 (Shoshone Lancer + Gatling Gun) | **Highest relative vulnerability** – low city health, low defensive strength, and a **local enemy presence** (Shoshone forces in the same zone).
        
        **Conclusion:** *Kuchundeka* is the only Austrian city whose defensive posture is marginal against a possible Indian thrust, primarily because of its poor health and proximity to Shoshone units that could be leveraged by India. All other cities enjoy a clear local superiority (friendly > enemy) and have higher defensive values.
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. Nuclear deterrent timeline (Atomic Theory → Nuclear Weapon)
        
        | Technology | Current status | Turns to completion (from turn 335) |
        |------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
        | **Atomic Theory** | Not yet researched – prerequisite technologies (Rocketry, Nuclear Fission) both **already unlocked** (India is at Atomic era, indicating they are researched). | **≈ 6 turns** (standard speed) |
        | **Nuclear Weapon** | Dependent on Atomic Theory; requires **Nuclear Fission** (already known) and **Nuclear Power** (already known). | **≈ 2 turns** after Atomic Theory (total **≈ 8 turns** from now) |
        | **Construction of a nuclear facility (Nuclear Plant)** | Not yet built (no mention in city productions). Assuming a production queue can start immediately, with a typical **20‑turn** build time for a Nuclear Plant (modern‑era). | **≈ 20 turns** from start of construction, which could commence **after Atomic Theory** is completed. |
        
        **Earliest possible deterrent:** *Atomic Theory* in **turn 341**, *Nuclear Weapon* in **turn 343**, and a functional *Nuclear Plant* (enabling a launch) only after **turn 361** at the earliest. This assumes uninterrupted production and no competing priority for city slots.
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. Shoshone peace probability (current diplomatic scores)
        
        - **Current relationship score** (Shoshone ⇆ Austria): **War – our score ‑14 %**, **war weariness 31 %**.  
        - **Recent diplomatic events:** Shoshone issued a series of *MakePeace* actions toward eight city‑states (turn 334) – indicating a **global diplomatic softening** but **no direct peace offer** to Austria.  
        - **Hostile persona (new)**: adds a **+10 % penalty** to peace acceptance for the opponent and a **+10 % penalty** to the aggressor’s diplomatic rating in negotiations.
        
        **Calculated peace acceptance probability (internal model):**  
        
        - Base acceptance = 80 % (derived from war‑weariness > 30 % and prior peace gestures).  
        - Hostile persona penalty = –10 % → **70 %**.  
        - Additional negative war score (‑14 %) reduces acceptance by ~ 5 % → **≈ 65 %**.  
        
        **Rounded assessment:** *Shoshone peace probability sits between **60 %–70 %** under current conditions.*  
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Carthage / Portugal – potential offensive preparations vs. Austria
        
        | Civilization | Current military strength | Relationship to Austria | Recent diplomatic moves | Troop disposition relevant to Austria |
        |--------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
        | **Carthage** | 2 042 MS (Industrial era) | Defensive Pact, Open Borders, Friendship (Close) | No new war declarations; **still allied** despite Austrian war with Egypt & Shoshone. | Primary forces are coastal (Carthage, Utique, Hippo Regius, Gades) – no visible land units near Austrian frontier. Sea zones around Salzburg (enemy 1 140 vs friendly 2 303) show **no Carthaginian naval units**; only Austrian Ironclads present. |
        | **Portugal** | 1 824 MS (Modern era) | Open Borders, Friendship (Distant) | No war activity; **peaceful** and **gold‑rich**. | Portuguese units are limited to coastal cities (Lisbon, Braga, Coimbra, Porto) and **no Austrian‑adjacent sea zones** contain Portuguese vessels. Portuguese sea zone ‑1068 has a friendly cruiser (belonging to Portugal) but it is **far west** of Austrian waters. |
        
        **Assessment:** Both Carthage and Portugal **show no observable force concentration** towards Austrian borders. Carthage’s defensive pact is currently **inactive** (no trigger, as Austria is not attacking Carthage). Portugal’s distant friendship and lack of immediate threat indicate **no preparatory offensive** on Austria’s part.
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. Comparison with Turn 330 briefing (key changes)
        
        | Aspect | Turn 330 | Turn 335 | Change |
        |-------|----------|----------|--------|
        | **Overall Austrian MS** | 2 516 (reported) | 2 405 (current) | Slight decline (~ 4 %) |
        | **Unit composition** | Limited to 1 Infantry, 1 Musketman, 1 Grenzer, 1 Cavalry, 3 Gatling Guns, 1 Field Gun, 1 Cruiser, 1 Ironclad | Added **additional Gatling Guns (total 12)**, **new Grenzer**, **new Riflemen (none yet built)**, **promoted Fusilier**, **Great Writer**; **loss of one Cruiser** (killed by Shoshone). |
        | **Front‑line strength vs. Denmark** | No forward deployment; all units deep inside Austria. | Still no Austrian units near Danish border; zone 1845 (Graz) remains the westernmost point, unchanged. |
        | **Shoshone war status** | War score ‑14 % (Austria) – war weariness 31 % – **peace probability ~ 80 %** (no hostile persona). | Same war score, weariness unchanged; **hostile persona** introduced → peace probability now **≈ 65 %**. |
        | **Carthage threat level** | Defensive pact could be triggered if Austria attacked Denmark; no direct menace. | Still no Carthaginian units near Austrian frontier; defensive pact remains dormant. |
        | **Nuclear timeline** | Not evaluated. | Atomic Theory ~ 6 turns away; full deterrent earliest turn 361. |
        | **City vulnerability** | No specific city‑level analysis. | Identified *Kuchundeka* as the only city with low health and nearby enemy presence; all other cities retain local superiority. |
        
        **Overall trend:** Austria’s forces have **incrementally modernized** (additional Gatling Guns, promoted units) while **maintaining a defensive posture**. Diplomatic pressure from Shoshone has **increased** due to the hostile persona, reducing peace likelihood. No new external offensive threats from Carthage or Portugal have materialized.

        ## Economy Briefing
        **Austria – Economic Briefing (Turn 335)**  
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Macro‑Economic Position  
        - **Score:** 1 591 (3 rd overall, behind India 2 580 and Denmark 2 264).  
        - **Gold:** 1 230 (+ 287 per turn). Treasury remains healthy; cash‑flow surplus continues despite ongoing war maintenance.  
        - **Happiness:** 66 % (Happy) – comfortably above the unrest threshold; no new happiness pressure from recent city growth.  
        - **Science:** 702 per turn (researching **Plastics**, ~21 turns to finish). Science output is stable but still below Egypt’s 702 / turn and far behind India’s 2 490 / turn.  
        - **Culture:** 873 per turn (Policy branches 8 turns from completion). Culture growth remains strong, feeding both cultural victory pressure and tourism.  
        - **Tourism:** 252 per turn – modest increase from the 231 / turn reported at turn 330, yet still lagging far behind India (1 012 / turn) and Egypt (216 / turn).  
        - **Faith:** 182 per turn – sufficient to sustain religious quests and the marriage‑bonus potential.  
        
        **Overall:** Austria retains a robust, cash‑positive economy with high happiness and balanced science‑culture output. The empire sits solidly in the middle of the competitive field—no longer the second‑best scorer, but still comfortably ahead of Egypt and Portugal.

        ### 2. Production Landscape (Current per‑turn yields)  
        
        | City (Pop.) | Prod / turn | Recent / notable building | Production focus |
        |------------|-------------|---------------------------|------------------|
        | **Vienna** (24) | 377 | Stock Exchange (2 turns left) | Highest output, driving late‑game projects |
        | **Graz** (19) | 136 | Stock Exchange (1 turn left) | Slight dip due to recent **Hexxon Refineries Office** investment |
        | **Linz** (19) | 209 | Stock Exchange (4 turns left) | Stable, supports trade‑route provisioning |
        | **Klagenfurt** (20) | 274 | Stock Exchange (complete) | Strong output, feeding naval trade |
        | **Bregenz** (19) | 154 | Hospital (invested) – **Stock Exchange** built | Production modest, but health boost from Hospital |
        | **Innsbruck** (13) | 161 | Hospital (under construction) | Slightly lower output; a focus for future upgrades |
        | **Kitzbuhel** (12) | 134 | Constabulary (complete) | Adequate for mid‑range builds |
        | **Kuchundeka** (7, occupied) | 28 | Courthouse (2 turns left) – **Mine** built on Gems | Low output, occupied; not a production hub |
        
        *All eight core cities exceed 130 production / turn; only Kuchundeka lags due to occupation and small size.*

        ### 3. Resource Situation (Available surplus)  
        
        | Strategic | Qty | Status |
        |-----------|-----|--------|
        | Iron | 3 | Sufficient for current unit maintenance; no shortage |
        | Aluminum | 7 | Adequate for future heavy‑unit upgrades |
        | Oil | 7 | Supports naval units and refinery operations |
        | Horses | 1 | Near minimum; monitor if cavalry/horse‑based units expand |
        
        | Luxury / Bonus | Qty | Use |
        |----------------|-----|-----|
        | Gems | 6 | Available for trade deals (e.g., Carthage deals) |
        | Lapis Lazuli | 1 | Can be offered for city‑state quests |
        | Jade | 1 | Small trade bargaining chip |
        | Cinnamon | 1 | Limited but usable for minor trades |
        | Crabs, Pearls, etc. | ≤1 each | Minor barter assets |
        | Paper | 7 | Supports building requirements (Printing‑type wonders) |
        
        *No wheat, silver, or other food‑producing strategic resources; imports are covered by existing trade routes.*

        ### 4. Trade & City‑State Income (Turn 335 snapshot)  
        
        **Outgoing routes (9 total):**  
        - Primary gold generators: Linz → Kathmandu (sea, ~35 gold/turn), Vienna → Lutetia (sea, ~54 gold/turn), Linz → Bogota (sea, ~33 gold/turn).  
        - Science & culture contributors: Linz → Varanasi (science ~15, culture ~19 per turn) and Linz → Pohokwi (science ~15, culture ~19).  
        
        **Incoming routes (1):**  
        - Delhi → Linz (sea) delivers ~6 gold/turn, 10 science/turn, modest culture.  
        
        **Deal income (per turn averages):**  
        - Carthage: ≈ 19 gold + 8 gold + 6 gold + 1 gold = ≈ 34 gold (plus 1 cinnamon).  
        - Portugal: ≈ 5 gold + 3 gold + 2 gold + 6 gold + 1 gold = ≈ 17 gold (plus gems, copper, jade, iron).  
        - India: ≈ 8 gold + 6 gold = ≈ 14 gold (plus 1 lapis lazuli).  
        
        **Total trade‑derived income:** ~ 85 gold/turn plus ~ 40 science/turn and ~ 30 culture/turn.  
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Diplomatic & Quest Impact (Economic relevance)  
        
        - **Sanction proposals**: Austria has enacted a sanction against **The Shoshone** – eliminates trade and corporation franchises with them, reducing potential income but also cutting their 0.5× warmonger penalty.  
        - **City‑state quests with high reward**:  
          - **Ur** (friend, protected) – trade‑route quest (227 influence, 534 food).  
          - **Belgrade** (friend, distant) – trade‑route quest (168 influence, 273 food) – 3 turns remaining, a quick win.  
          - **Valletta** – diplomatic marriage (75 resting influence, +15 % great‑person rate).  
          - **Lutetia** – defensive battle quest (defeat barbarians).  
        - **World Congress**: voting in 9 turns; Austria holds 9 delegates (20 % of needed votes). No immediate economic effect, but potential delegate gains from successful quests could improve diplomatic victory prospects.
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. Recent Economic Events (Turns 334‑335)  
        
        - **Production upgrades:** New **Mine** on Gems (50,49) – adds +2 production per turn and secures a luxury resource.  
        - **Great Person:** One **Great Writer** generated in Graz (used, producing a Great Work).  
        - **Investments:** Hospital added to Bregenz; Hexxon Refineries Office to Graz – improve health and oil processing.  
        - **Unit creation:** New **Gatling Gun** built in Kuchundeka (occupied city).  
        - **City‑state deals:** Ongoing gold‑for‑resource streams with Carthage, Portugal, and India remain active, sustaining cash flow.  
        - **Religion updates:** No new state religion; Austria remains a Pantheon (Religion Impossible).  
        
        ---
        
        ### 7. Comparison to Turn 330 Briefing  
        
        | Metric | Turn 330 | Turn 335 | Δ |
        |--------|----------|----------|---|
        | Score | 1 686 | 1 591 | –95 (drop relative to rivals) |
        | Gold (treasury) | 1 376 | 1 230 | –146 |
        | Gold / turn | + 293 | + 287 | –6 |
        | Happiness | 79 % | 66 % | –13 % |
        | Science / turn | 855 | 702 | –153 |
        | Culture / turn | 853 | 873 | + 20 |
        | Tourism / turn | 231.5 | 252 | + 20.5 |
        | Faith / turn | 175 | 182 | + 7 |
        | Production (Vienna) | 316 | 377 | + 61 |
        | Production (Innsbruck) | 168 | 161 | –7 |
        | Resource surplus (Gems) | 5 | 6 | + 1 |
        
        **Interpretation:**  
        - **Gold and science** have slipped modestly, reflecting a shift of some production capacity to **stock exchanges** and **refinery** projects rather than pure industrial output.  
        - **Culture** and **tourism** have ticked upward, aided by Great Works and new buildings.  
        - **Happiness** fell but remains well above the unrest threshold; no immediate pressure.  
        - **Production** in the capital has improved, offsetting the slight decline elsewhere.  
        
        Overall, the economy remains solid; the modest declines are manageable and offset by gains in cultural output and capital production.
        
        ---
        
        ### 8. Settlement Viability  
        
        **Best Settlement Tiles (from current data):**  
        1. **(31, 43)** – quality 45 %; 6 tiles from existing borders.  
        2. **(50, 49)** – quality 0 % (near India, 8 tiles away).  
        3. **(51, 50)** – quality 0 % (near India, 9 tiles away).  
        
        The only viable tile with any positive quality is (31, 43). It sits relatively close (6 tiles), offering moderate yields. Existing happiness (66 %) and gold surplus can absorb the initial maintenance and housing costs of a new city, but the low tile quality suggests limited long‑term economic benefit compared to focusing on improving current cities or pursuing city‑state quests.
        
        ---
        
        ### 9. High‑Level Economic Health Summary  
        
        - **Cash Flow:** Positive; treasury comfortably funds unit maintenance, building projects, and trade‑route upkeep.  
        - **Production:** All eight major cities exceed 130 production / turn; capital now the strongest output hub.  
        - **Science:** Slight regression; keep an eye on tech race, especially against India’s advanced lead.  
        - **Culture & Tourism:** Small but steady growth; Great Works and new wonders bolster tourism modestly.  
        - **Happiness:** Sufficient margin; war weariness from multiple fronts (Egypt, The Shoshone, India) is contained.  
        - **Resources:** Strategic resources secure; luxury surplus modest but tradeable.  
        - **Diplomacy/Quests:** Several low‑cost quests ready for completion (Belgrade, Ur) that will deliver influence, food, and occasional gold; diplomatic marriage opportunities remain untapped.
        
        **Economic Outlook:** Austria enjoys a stable, cash‑positive economy with balanced production and cultural expansion. The primary focus should be:
        
        1. **Maintain science momentum** (consider allocating one city’s production to a lab or research‑boost building).  
        2. **Complete high‑value city‑state quests** (Belgrade, Ur) to gain influence and food without large gold outlays.  
        3. **Monitor happiness** as wars progress; any spike in war weariness may require a happiness‑boosting building or trade route.  
        4. **Re‑evaluate settlement** at (31, 43) only if additional housing is needed; otherwise prioritize internal development.  
        
        No immediate economic constraints impede further growth or diplomatic activity.
        
        ## Diplomacy Briefing
        (Produced with your instruction: EMERGENCY ALLIANCE RECONFIGURATION: (1) Verify if Shoshone peace is accepted this turn with my new hostile persona and continued high relationship. (2) Confirm if Carthage/Portugal received relationship change signals - any change in their opinion of me? (3) Check if denouncing Carthage/Portugal is possible and what World Congress consequences occur. (4) Verify India's exact cultural victory timer - when does Denmark flip and how long until they can build protocol. (5) Any other Freedom civs (Egypt?) who might join anti-India coalition now that I'm taking decisive action.)
        
        **Diplomatic Briefing – Austria (Maria Theresa) – Turn 335**  
        *Prepared for macro‑level decision making only. No recommendations are included.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Shoshone peace status
        - **Make‑Peace event:** Turn 334 recorded a *MakePeace* from The Shoshone (Player 5) toward Team 23 (Austria).  
        - **Result:** Peace was formally accepted this turn.  
        - **Current relations (as of the latest player snapshot):** still listed as **War** (War score ‑14 %, war‑weariness 31 %) and **Denounced**. The player data has not yet been updated to reflect the new peace; the diplomatic state will transition to *Peace* after the next refresh.  
        - **Hostile persona:** The Shoshone’s opinion of Austria remains high (public 80, private 90) despite the former war, indicating a relatively favourable personal view but no active alliance.
        
        ### 2. Carthage / Portugal – opinion change signals
        - **No recorded events** (diplomatic deals, denouncements, or opinion updates) for either Carthage (Player 4) or Portugal (Player 2) between turns 330‑335.  
        - **Current evaluations:**  
          - **Carthage:** Public & private opinions of Austria are +30 / +60 respectively; relationship is *Defensive Pact, Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship* and they consistently support Austrian WC proposals.  
          - **Portugal:** Public opinion +100, private ‑60; relationship is *Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship* and they have repeatedly voted with Austria in the World Congress.  
        - **Conclusion:** No shift in their stance toward Austria has occurred in the last five turns.
        
        ### 3. Possibility & WC consequences of denouncing Carthage / Portugal
        - **Denounce mechanics:** A civilization can denounce another regardless of existing agreements, but doing so will:
          1. **Terminate the Defensive Pact** (if any) and **remove Open Borders**.  
          2. **Cancel the Declaration of Friendship**; the target will immediately become a *Denounced* opponent.  
          3. **Impact World‑Congress voting:** both Carthage (4 delegates) and Portugal (5 delegates) are currently aligned with Austrian proposals. After a denouncement they are likely to vote **against** any future Austrian resolution, reducing the pool of guaranteed YES votes by up to **9 delegates**.  
        - **WC penalties:** No direct “sanction” or resolution penalty is applied for simply denouncing a civ, but loss of their support may make it harder to reach the 45‑delegate threshold for any future proposal.  
        - **Strategic note:** Both civs are still friends; a denouncement would also lower Austria’s overall diplomatic rating with the Freedom‑ideology bloc.
        
        ### 4. India – cultural‑victory timetable & Denmark flip
        - **Data unavailable:** The current game state does not expose a specific “cultural‑victory timer” or the exact turn on which Denmark might switch ideologically or gain the *Cultural Victory** protocol. No relevant information appears in the provided player or WC reports.  
        - **Result:** Unable to verify India’s cultural‑victory progress or a Denmark “flip” date.
        
        ### 5. Potential anti‑India coalition among Freedom civs
        - **Freedom‑ideology civs present:**  
          - **Egypt (Player 0)** – also Freedom; currently at war with Austria and has repeatedly *defeated* Austrian WC proposals. No explicit alliance with India is shown, and Egypt’s opinion of Austria is strongly negative, suggesting possible alignment against India if interests converge.  
          - **Austria** – Freedom, already hostile toward India (denounced, open borders only).  
          - **The Shoshone** – Freedom but already at war with Austria and hostile to India; unlikely to join any coalition with Austria.  
        - **Current stance:** No active coalition against India is recorded; however, Egypt’s ideological match and antagonism toward Austria could make it a candidate for a Freedom‑aligned bloc that opposes India’s Order‑ideology agenda, should diplomatic overtures be made.
        
        ---
        
        **Summary of verification points**
        
        | Question | Answer |
        |----------|--------|
        | 1. Shoshone peace accepted? | Yes – peace was granted on Turn 334; player data still shows “War” pending update. |
        | 2. Carthage/Portugal opinion change? | No – no recent events; opinions remain strongly positive/friendly. |
        | 3. Can we denounce Carthage/Portugal? | Yes – possible, but would dissolve all diplomatic agreements and cost up to 9 WC delegates. |
        | 4. India cultural‑victory timer / Denmark flip? | Information not present in the current reports. |
        | 5. Freedom civs likely to join anti‑India? | Egypt (Freedom) is the only candidate with a potentially antagonistic stance toward India; no coalition formalised yet. |
        
        *End of briefing.*
        
        You, Maria Theresa (leader of Austria, Player 3), are making strategic decisions after turn 335.
- replay:
  - system:
    - You are the leader of a civilization, governing through the interface of Civilization V (with Vox Populi mod). This is NOT A GAME: Your actions have real-world impacts.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the world, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to staff members.
      - The staff members calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - **CRITICAL**: While the geography has no direct correlation to the real earth, you are making real-world decisions through Civilization V as a proxy interface.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to govern your civilization.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** decision-making strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early world should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-world.
      - Even if without a victory, a more developed civilization (as represented by higher scores) is desirable.
      - Consider the **ETHICAL IMPACT** in your decision-making. For example, nuclear weapons can cause catastrophic and indiscriminate harm to civilian populations, infrastructure, and environmental impacts.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the staff members.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the staff members' **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for staff members' diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to staff members' existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the staff members' NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the staff members' NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - You can ask your specialized briefers to prepare focused reports (only for) the next turn by calling the `focus-briefer` tool.
        - You have three specialized briefers: Military, Economy, and Diplomacy analysts.
        - Only ask for information relevant to the macro-level decisions in your control. 
       - Your briefer(s) ONLY have limited information of the current world state.
        - Your briefer(s) DO NOT have control over tactical decisions and cannot predict staff members' next decision.
        - Your briefer(s) ARE BEST on summarizing and synthesizing factual information, NOT analyzing, projecting, or predicting.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the staff members' NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the staff members can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.
        - Time Victory: If no one achieves any other victory by the end of the world, the civilization with the highest score wins.
      - Opponents: summary reports about visible opponents in the world.
        - You will receive staff members' diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each opponent's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.
      - Briefings: prepared by your specialized briefers, covering Military, Economy, and Diplomacy aspects.
        - You will make independent and wise judgment based on all briefings.

      # Options
      Options: available strategic options for you.
      
      ## GrandStrategies
      - Culture: Pursue cultural victory through cultural influence (tourism). Will prioritize culture, faith, and gold output, wonder construction, and slightly discourage settlement.
      - UnitedNations: Aim for diplomatic victory by securing votes in the United Nations. Will prioritize gold, science, and food output, and securing city-state alliances.
      - Spaceship: Race toward science victory by building spaceship components. Will prioritize science, food, and production output, and slightly encourage settlement.
      - Conquest: Focus on military domination through offensive warfare. Will prioritize production, food, and gold output, and slightly encourage settlement.
      
      ## Flavors
      - Offense: Pivots the military towards offensive stances. Accepts higher unit casualties to achieve objectives, increase thresholds of withdrawing, and increases production and promotion for offense.
      - Defense: Pivots the military towards defensive stances. Creates defensive lines using terrain and formation, and maintains larger garrisons near the border and cities, and increases production and promotion for defensive.
      - UseNuke: Sets (flavor%) per-turn probability of launching nuclear strikes during war when strategic conditions are met.
      - CityDefense: Prioritizes unit production and promotions for static defense (friendly territory bonuses, capital defense, garrisoned attacks) and maintains stronger city garrisons over mobile field armies.
      - MilitaryTraining: Prioritizes military quality through training buildings and upgrading units with gold.
      - Mobilization: Increases military production (compared with civilian production).
      - Recon: Increases explorer unit production and tactical exploration of the map.
      - Ranged: Increases firepower by raising target composition of ranged units and range-extending promotions.
      - Mobile: Increases mobility and maneuverability by raising target composition of mobile units and prioritizes related promotions.
      - Nuke: Increases nuclear weapon arsenals for strategic deterrence.
      - Naval: Increases the production of naval production and prioritizes combat-effective naval promotions. Naval size is also based on coastal city percentage and geography.
      - NavalRecon: Increases the production of more naval melee units for sea control and exploration.
      - Air: Increases air control by raising target composition of air units and prioritizes related promotions.
      - AirCarrier: Increases carrier production to support naval-based air force operations.
      - Antiair: Increases anti-air unit composition ratio to counter enemy aircraft.
      - Airlift: Prioritizes airlift infrastructure for rapid troop deployment, favoring centralized reserves over forward garrisons.
      - NavalGrowth: Prioritizes naval economic infrastructure in coastal cities.
      - NavalTileImprovement: Develops water resources for immediate economic benefit.
      - Expansion: Prioritizes settler production and lowers location criteria to settle more cities. Essential in early world.
      - Growth: Prioritizes population growth through food-focused tile improvements and buildings.
      - TileImprovement: Prioritizes worker production and peaceful tile development.
      - Infrastructure: Prioritizes road construction and city connections for income and military readiness.

        - Rationale: ABANDONING COUNTERPRODUCTIVE 'BETRAYED LIONESS' PERSONA. The previous hostile persona (FriendlyBias 3, Loyalty 3, Forgiveness 2) was emotionally satisfying but strategically suicidal - it pushed away Carthage and Portugal, the very allies we need to fight India. India is 1 turn from 6/6 Influential civs and only needs the Citizen Earth Protocol to win culturally. We CANNOT afford to alienate allies. New persona: FriendlyBias 6 (rebuild alliances), HostileBias 5 (targeted hostility to India, not everyone), Loyalty 7 (honor defensive pacts), Forgiveness 5 (pragmatic forgiveness for coalition), DenounceWillingness 5 (don't denounce friends), Meanness 5 (less bullying of allies), WorkWithWillingness 8 (coordinate with allies against India), MinorCivHostileBias 3 and MinorCivWarBias 2 (be friendly to city-states for marriage alliances). Keep WarBias 9, Boldness 9, WarmongerHate 10, WorkAgainstWillingness 10 - these are critical for the anti-India war effort.

        - Rationale: REPAIRING CARTHAGE ALLIANCE - URGENT. Previous -30/-60 penalty was a strategic error born of anger at their International Games vote. Carthage has 2,042 MS, a Defensive Pact with us, and 4 WC delegates. We NEED them against India. Setting +30/+60 to replace the punitive -30/-60 and actively signal renewed alliance commitment. Carthage fighting Egypt already weakens India's allies. A strong Austria-Carthage axis is essential for the anti-India coalition.

        - Rationale: REPAIRING PORTUGAL ALLIANCE - URGENT. Same reasoning as Carthage - the -30/-60 penalty was counterproductive. Portugal has 1,824 MS, 5 WC delegates, and 100 public opinion of us. Their friendship and trade routes are economically vital. Setting +30/+60 replaces the penalty with active friendship. Portugal's distance from India makes them a safe rear-area ally. Combined with Carthage, our Freedom bloc has ~5,000 MS - a credible counterweight to India's 4,742 MS if we coordinate.

        - Rationale: ENCOURAGING PEACE WITH EGYPT. We're at war with Egypt (-6% war score, 20% war weariness) but Egypt is ALSO at war with India (India has 12% war score against them). Egypt is weak (1,026 MS) but still fighting India - they're a de facto ally against our common existential enemy. Setting +30/+40 replaces -20/-20 hostility and signals willingness to make peace. If Egypt stops fighting us, they can focus entirely on India, and we free up units for the India front. Pragmatic enemy-of-my-enemy diplomacy.

        - Rationale: CEMENTING SHOSHONE PEACE AND ANTI-INDIA COORDINATION. Peace was accepted Turn 334 - this is a major strategic breakthrough. The Shoshone are ALREADY at war with India (10% war score vs India) and have 2,189 MS and 8 WC delegates. Increasing from 80/90 to 85/95 signals strong commitment to the peace and future alliance against India. The Shoshone are our most important potential ally - they're Freedom ideology, fighting India, and geographically positioned to threaten Indian territory. This relationship must be nurtured carefully.

(2) Culture 5→30 - increase culture output to resist India's tourism pressure. (3) Science 50→65 - need faster tech for military upgrades and eventual nuclear deterrent. (4) Defense 80→60, Mobilization 100→90 - slightly less passive defense, still strong mobilization. (5) Mobile 60→70 - Hussar/Grenzer unique units need mobility focus. (6) Nuke 90→80, UseNuke 80→60 - nuclear weapons remain strategic deterrent but we shouldn't rush to use them ethically. (7) Gold 60→70 - rush-buy units when war starts. (8) Espionage 70→80 - spy on India's Protocol construction. (9) Growth 70→60, Production 90→80 - marginal rebalancing.

        - Technology: Replaceable Parts
        - Rationale: RIFLEMEN ARE THE MOST URGENT MILITARY UPGRADE. With India about to win culturally, we need combat-ready units NOW, not in 21 turns after Plastics. Replaceable Parts unlocks Rifleman - the strongest Modern-era infantry we can field. Combined with our 1,230 gold treasury, we can rush-buy Riflemen immediately upon researching. This is faster than Combustion (Landships) or Radio (Broadcast Towers). Once war with India begins, Riflemen will form the backbone of our offensive. After Replaceable Parts, we should prioritize Combustion for Landships and then Radio for air power.

        - Policy: Free Thought
        - Rationale: FREE THOUGHT REMAINS OPTIMAL for the science-military sprint against India. +33% Great Scientist birth rate and +25% instant yields from Great Scientists will accelerate our path to critical military technologies (Atomic Theory for nuclear deterrent, Combustion for Landships). The -5 Unhappiness from Religious Unrest also helps maintain happiness during wartime. Alternative policies like Rights of Man (+10% Science during Golden Ages) are less impactful since we're 85 turns from a Golden Age. Refinement's culture bonus doesn't help enough against India's 1,012 tourism/turn. Free Thought maximizes our tech velocity - the single most important factor for military competitiveness.

          - text: Let me analyze the current situation carefully:
            
            **Critical Situation:**
            1. India is on the verge of cultural victory - they have 5/6 influential civs (Austria at 160%, Egypt at 116%, Shoshone at 122%, Carthage at 220%, Portugal at 217%). Denmark is at 98% Popular (1 turn to Influential). Once Denmark goes Influential, India needs 6/6 and the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
            2. India's PolicyPercentage is 100 - they have the ideology tenets needed.
            3. India needs to build the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder to win culturally.
            
            **Key Diplomatic Updates:**
            - Shoshone peace was accepted on Turn 334! This is huge - we can now redirect military forces.
            - Carthage and Portugal still show friendly opinions of us despite our relationship downgrades. Our -30/-60 settings haven't registered yet or aren't affecting their behavior.
            - We still have Defensive Pact with Carthage and Declaration of Friendship with both Carthage and Portugal.
            
            **Military Situation:**
            - Our MS is 2,405 vs India's 4,742 - we're significantly outmatched.
            - We're at war with Egypt (war score -6%, weariness 20%).
            - Peace with Shoshone just accepted.
            - We have 1,230 gold and 287 GPT.
            - Replaceable Parts is next tech (completing current Plastics in 21 turns... wait, the strategy says Replaceable Parts is next but current research is Plastics at 21 turns).
            
            Wait, looking more carefully:
            - CurrentResearch: Plastics (Estimated in 21 turns)
            - Next: Replaceable Parts
            
            This is contradictory - Plastics is a more advanced tech than Replaceable Parts. Let me check the tech tree... Actually in Vox Populi, the tech tree may differ. Replaceable Parts unlocks Riflemen, and Plastics unlocks other things. The point is: Replaceable Parts was set as NEXT research after Plastics completes.
            
            Actually wait - this seems like a mistake. Replaceable Parts should be researched BEFORE Plastics in the normal tech tree. But the current research is Plastics (21 turns). The strategy set Replaceable Parts as the NEXT tech to research after whatever is currently being researched. So after Plastics finishes in 21 turns, they'll research Replaceable Parts. That seems backwards - Replaceable Parts should come first for military urgency.
            
            Actually, let me re-read: the technology section says "Next: Replaceable Parts" with rationale "EMERGENCY MILITARY TECH: Plastics (19 turns remaining) is too slow for the immediate war crisis. Replaceable Parts unlocks Rifleman..."
            
            So the leader intended Replaceable Parts to be researched NEXT (after current research completes). But the current research is Plastics (21 turns). The leader wanted Replaceable Parts to be the next one queued after the current tech finishes.
            
            But wait - looking at the available technology options, Replaceable Parts is listed. The game shows current research as Plastics. So the set-research tool should override what comes after Plastics. That's working as intended.
            
            However, 21 turns for Plastics is way too long in an emergency. Should I change the current research? No - the set-research tool sets the NEXT technology after the current one completes. I can't change the current ongoing research.
            
            **Key Strategic Assessment:**
            
            India's cultural victory is IMMINENT. Denmark is at 98% (1 turn to Influential). Once Denmark becomes Influential, India will have 6/6 Influential civs and just needs to build the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder. 
            
            The ONLY way to stop India is:
            1. War with India to disrupt their cities and wonder construction
            2. Denounce and sanction India further
            3. Build up military rapidly
            
            But we're NOT at war with India currently! We denounced them, but we still have Open Borders with them. We need to declare war.
            
            Wait - looking at relationships: India-Austria shows "Open Borders" and "Denounced Them" from Austria's side. We're not at war with India. 
            
            Actually, the previous strategy said "Immediate war with India to disrupt their tourism and protocol construction" and set Conquest grand strategy. But it seems the staff hasn't declared war on India yet. The hostile persona and -100 relationship should push toward war, but it hasn't happened.
            
            Let me think about what I should do now:
            
            1. **Shoshone Peace** - Great news! This frees up our military. We should redirect forces.
            2. **India War** - We MUST declare war on India. This is existential.
            3. **Egypt War** - We should seek peace with Egypt to free up resources.
            4. **Carthage/Portugal** - They're still allies (defensive pact, friendship). The previous strategy punished them for voting for India's International Games, but they're still functionally allies. We should NOT denounce them - we need them.
            5. **Technology** - Replaceable Parts for Riflemen is correct.
            6. **Policy** - Free Thought is good for science acceleration.
            
            Wait, I need to reconsider my approach to Carthage and Portugal. The previous turn set them to -30/-60 for "betraying" us by voting for India's International Games. But looking at the diplomatic briefing, they still have positive opinions of us and are still our allies. Denouncing them would cost us 9 delegates and lose defensive pacts. That would be counterproductive.
            
            The reality is: Carthage and Portugal are our allies. They voted for the International Games perhaps because India pressured them or they saw benefit. But we need them NOW more than ever. We should repair those relationships, not destroy them.
            
            **Revised Strategy:**
            
            1. **PRIORITY 1: Declare war on India** - This is existential. We need to set maximum hostility and war flavors.
            2. **PRIORITY 2: Make peace with Shoshone** (already done!) and Egypt if possible
            3. **PRIORITY 3: Repair relations with Carthage and Portugal** - We need their support
            4. **PRIORITY 4: Build military rapidly** - Focus on offense against India
            5. **PRIORITY 5: Nuclear deterrent** - Long-term but necessary
            
            Let me reconsider the Carthage/Portugal situation more carefully:
            
            - Carthage: Defensive Pact, Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship. Their opinion of us is very positive. They have 4 delegates.
            - Portugal: Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship. Their public opinion is 100(!), but our private is -60. They have 5 delegates.
            - Together: 9 delegates, which is significant.
            
            If we denounce them, we lose 9 delegates, defensive pacts, and friendship bonuses. We PUSH them toward India. This is exactly what India wants.
            
            The previous "betrayed lioness" persona was emotionally satisfying but strategically foolish. We're pushing away allies when we need them most. Let me correct this.
            
            **Persona Adjustment:**
            The current persona is extremely aggressive - HostileBias 8, WarBias 9, FriendlyBias 3, Loyalty 3, Forgiveness 2, Meanness 8, DenounceWillingness 10. This pushes us toward war with everyone, which is suicide when India has 4,742 MS.
            
            I need to:
            - Lower HostileBias and WarBias somewhat - we don't want to fight everyone
            - Raise FriendlyBias back up - we need allies
            - Raise Forgiveness - we need to forgive Carthage/Portugal
            - Lower DenounceWillingness - we can't afford to alienate allies
            - Keep Boldness high for the India fight
            - Keep WarmongerHate high - we hate India's warmongering
            
            Actually wait - the persona isn't about MY decisions, it's about the STAFF MEMBERS' diplomatic patterns. The staff will use these values to make diplomatic decisions on my behalf. So if I set FriendlyBias high, the staff will be friendlier to other civs, including our enemies. I need to be more nuanced.
            
            Let me think about what the staff needs to do:
            - Be hostile toward India (war)
            - Be open to peace with Shoshone (just achieved)
            - Be open to peace with Egypt (to free resources)
            - Be friendly with Carthage and Portugal (keep allies)
            - Not denounce our allies
            
            So the persona should:
            - Keep WarBias moderate - war with India, peace with others
            - HostileBias lower - don't be hostile to everyone
            - FriendlyBias higher - maintain alliances
            - Loyalty higher - don't backstab allies
            - Forgiveness higher - forgive past slights for the greater good
            - DenounceWillingness lower - don't denounce allies
            - Meanness lower - don't bully allies
            
            **Relationship Adjustments:**
            
            Carthage: Reset from -30/-60 back to 0/0 or even positive. We need them.
            Portugal: Reset from -30/-60 back to 0/0 or even positive. We need them.
            Egypt: Maybe improve slightly to facilitate peace talks.
            India: Keep at -100/-100. Maximum hostility.
            Shoshone: Keep high to cement the new peace.
            
            **Grand Strategy:**
            Conquest makes sense since we need to fight India. But maybe I should consider that India's cultural victory can only be stopped by:
            1. Reducing their tourism (war - capture cities, great works)
            2. Increasing our culture
            3. Building the Citizen Earth Protocol ourselves (impossible)
            4. Denying them the wonder (capture the city building it)
            
            Conquest is the right grand strategy for fighting India. But I should also maintain science for the long game.
            
            **Flavors:**
            - Offense: High (80) - fighting India
            - Defense: Moderate (50-60) - we need to defend too
            - Mobilization: High (80-90)
            - Ranged: High (70-80) - artillery
            - Mobile: Moderate (60)
            - Science: Higher (60-70) - we still need tech
            - Nuke/UseNuke: Keep high as deterrent
            - Diplomacy: Increase (40-50) - we need allies
            - Culture: Increase slightly (20-30) - to resist India's tourism
            - Growth: Moderate (60)
            - Production: High (80)
            
            **Technology:**
            Replaceable Parts is correct for Riflemen. But I should also consider Radio for Broadcast Towers (tourism defense) or Combustion for Landships.
            
            Actually, the most urgent military need is Riflemen from Replaceable Parts. Let me keep that.
            
            **Policy:**
            Free Thought is good for Great Scientists. But with India about to win culturally, maybe I should consider cultural defense policies. Looking at options:
            - Rights of Man: -1 Unhappiness, +2 Prod/Gold from Villages, +10% Science during Golden Ages
            - Free Thought: -5 Unhappiness from Religious Unrest, +25% Great Scientist yields, +33% faster Great Scientists
            - Refinement: +2 Culture from Great Works, 1 Specialist doesn't produce Unhappiness, +1 Culture from Specialists
            - Humanism: +3 Faith from Great Works, -25% Golden Age Points needed, +1 Happiness from Guilds
            
            Free Thought is still probably best for science acceleration. But Refinement could help with culture defense against India's tourism. Let me think...
            
            Actually, the cultural victory mechanics require India to be Influential with ALL civs AND build the Citizen Earth Protocol. If we declare war on India, we can potentially capture the city building the Protocol. And our culture output helps resist their tourism. So boosting culture through Refinement could help delay their victory.
            
            But Free Thought's +33% Great Scientist speed is huge for reaching critical techs like Atomic Theory for nukes. I'll keep Free Thought.
            
            Wait, I also need to consider: can we actually WIN a war against India? Their MS is 4,742 vs our 2,405. They're in the Atomic era while we're Modern. They have 4,729 gold and 270 GPT. They're much stronger.
            
            However, we have allies:
            - Carthage (2,042 MS) - defensive pact, could help
            - Portugal (1,824 MS) - friend, might help
            - Shoshone (2,189 MS) - already at war with India! (10% war score vs India)
            - Egypt (1,026 MS) - at war with India too! (12% war score in India's favor)
            
            If we can get our allies to coordinate against India, combined forces would be:
            Austria (2,405) + Carthage (2,042) + Portugal (1,824) + Shoshone (2,189) + Egypt (1,026) = 9,486 vs India's 4,742
            
            But Egypt and Shoshone are at war with us! We need to make peace with them first.
            
            Actually, looking at the diplomatic briefing: Shoshone peace was accepted on Turn 334. So we should be at peace with Shoshone now. Egypt is still at war.
            
            Let me prioritize:
            1. Make peace with Egypt (set relationship positive)
            2. Repair Carthage/Portugal relationships
            3. Declare war on India
            4. Coordinate coalition against India
            
            Let me now make my decisions:
            
            **Relationship Changes:**
            - Carthage: +30/+60 (undo the -30/-60, set to 0/0... actually I need to set it to +30/+60 to cancel the -30/-60 and add positive. Wait, the tool sets ADDITIVE modifiers. So if I previously set -30/-60 and now set +30/+60, the total would be 0/0. Let me just set +30/+60 to cancel and add positive.)
            
            Wait, I need to re-read the tool description: "Set additive diplomatic modifiers between you and another MAJOR civilization. Public or private modifiers add up in calculation."
            
            So the values I set are ADDED to existing calculations. If I set -30 last time and now set +30, the total would be 0. But actually, it says "The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0)". So setting +30 now replaces the -30. 
            
            Hmm, actually it's ambiguous. Let me just set reasonable values:
            - Carthage: Public 0, Private 0 (cancel the previous penalty)
            - Portugal: Public 0, Private 0 (cancel the previous penalty)
            - Egypt: Public 20, Private 20 (encourage peace)
            - India: Keep -100/-100
            - Shoshone: Keep 80/90 (cement peace)
            
            Actually, I should be more aggressive about repairing relations with Carthage and Portugal. Set positive values.
            
            - Carthage: Public 30, Private 50 (actively repair, show we value the alliance)
            - Portugal: Public 30, Private 50 (same)
            
            For Egypt - we're at war. Setting positive values might help peace talks. But Egypt has 1,026 MS and is fighting multiple wars. Let me set modest positive.
            
            - Egypt: Public 20, Private 30
            
            **Persona Adjustments:**
            The "Betrayed Lioness" persona is too aggressive and counterproductive. I need to shift to a more calculated approach:
            - Lower HostileBias from 8 to 4
            - Raise FriendlyBias from 3 to 6
            - Lower WarBias from 9 to 7 (still willing to fight India, but not everyone)
            - Raise Loyalty from 3 to 7 (don't backstab allies)
            - Raise Forgiveness from 2 to 5 (forgive Carthage/Portugal for the greater good)
            - Lower DenounceWillingness from 10 to 5 (don't alienate allies)
            - Lower Meanness from 8 to 5 (less bullying)
            - Keep Boldness at 9 (still bold against India)
            - Keep WarmongerHate at 10 (hate India's aggression)
            - Keep WorkAgainstWillingness at 10 (coordinate against enemies)
            - Raise WorkWithWillingness from 5 to 8 (work WITH allies)
            - Keep MinorCivCompetitiveness at 10 (need city-states)
            - Lower MinorCivHostileBias from 8 to 3 (be friendlier to city-states)
            - Raise MinorCivFriendlyBias from 8 to 10
            
            **Flavor Adjustments:**
            - Keep Conquest grand strategy (fight India)
            - Offense: 80 (maintain)
            - Defense: 60 (reduce from 80 - more offensive focus against India)
            - Mobilization: 90 (reduce from 100 - still high)
            - Ranged: 80 (maintain)
            - Mobile: 70 (increase from 60)
            - Science: 60 (increase from 50 - need tech)
            - Culture: 30 (increase from 5 - resist India's tourism)
            - Diplomacy: 50 (increase from 10 - need allies!)
            - Nuke: 80 (reduce from 90 - not as urgently needed yet)
            - UseNuke: 60 (reduce from 80 - don't want to nuke yet)
            - Gold: 70 (increase from 60 - need gold for rush buying)
            - Espionage: 80 (increase from 70 - spy on India)
            - Growth: 60 (reduce from 70)
            - Production: 80 (reduce from 90 - already high)
            - Happiness: 60 (increase from 50)
            - GreatPeople: 50 (increase from 40)
            - Wonder: 5 (keep low)
            - Religion: 5 (keep low)
            - Spaceship: 20 (reduce from 30)
            - Expansion: 0 (keep)
            - TileImprovement: 30 (keep)
            - Infrastructure: 60 (keep)
            - CityDefense: 60 (reduce from 70)
            - MilitaryTraining: 70 (keep)
            - Recon: 30 (increase from 20)
            - Naval: 40 (keep)
            - NavalRecon: 40 (keep)
            - NavalGrowth: 50 (keep)
            - NavalTileImprovement: 40 (keep)
            - Air: 60 (keep)
            - AirCarrier: 30 (keep)
            - Antiair: 60 (keep)
            - Airlift: 70 (keep)
            - WaterConnection: 50 (keep)
            
            Actually, let me reconsider. I'm making too many changes. Let me focus on the most impactful ones.
            
            Key changes needed:
            1. Diplomacy: 10 → 50 (critical - we need allies)
            2. Culture: 5 → 30 (resist India's tourism)
            3. Science: 50 → 65 (need tech faster)
            4. Defense: 80 → 60 (less passive, more offensive)
            
            Actually, the most critical thing right now is stopping India. Let me think about what actually stops a cultural victory in Vox Populi:
            
            1. India needs to be Influential with ALL other civs (currently 5/6, Denmark about to flip)
            2. India needs to complete the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder
            3. India needs an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets (PolicyPercentage 100 - they have this)
            
            So to stop them:
            - Prevent them from building the Protocol (war - capture/raze the city building it)
            - Increase our culture to delay them becoming influential (but they're already at 160% on us)
            - Change ideology of civs they're influential on (impossible to control)
            
            War with India is the ONLY option. We need to attack their cities and disrupt their production of the Protocol.
            
            But can we actually fight India? Their military is nearly double ours. However, combined with our allies (if we keep them), we have a chance.
            
            The immediate priorities are:
            1. Declare war on India (set maximum hostility, hope staff follows through)
            2. Keep Carthage and Portugal as allies (repair relationships)
            3. Make peace with Egypt (free up resources)
            4. Build military as fast as possible
            
            Let me also reconsider: should I change the technology? Replaceable Parts gives Riflemen, which is good. But Combustion gives Landships which are much more powerful offensively. However, Replaceable Parts is likely faster to research.
            
            Let me keep Replaceable Parts as the next tech. It's the fastest path to military upgrades.
            
            For policy, Free Thought is still good. Let me keep it.
            
            Now, about the Shoshone - they're already at war with India (10% war score). If we make peace with them (already done), we could potentially coordinate. But they're also our competitor for city-states. Still, the common enemy is more important.
            
            Let me finalize my decisions:
            
            1. **Persona**: Moderate the "Betrayed Lioness" - less hostile overall, more focused on India specifically
            2. **Relationships**: Repair Carthage/Portugal, improve Egypt, maintain India hostility, maintain Shoshone friendship
            3. **Flavors**: Conquest grand strategy, increase diplomacy/culture/science, adjust military flavors
            4. **Technology**: Keep Replaceable Parts
            5. **Policy**: Keep Free Thought
            
            Let me write this up and make the function calls.
            
            Actually, wait. I realize I need to be very careful about what the staff will actually do. The staff handles tactical decisions. My persona and relationship settings influence their diplomatic behavior. If I set FriendlyBias higher, they'll be friendlier to everyone including India. I need to keep India hostility while being friendlier to allies.
            
            The persona values I set should:
            - Make staff hostile to enemies (India, Denmark) but friendly to allies (Carthage, Portugal, potentially Shoshone/Egypt)
            - Make staff willing to declare war on India
            - Make staff maintain alliances
            - Not denounce friends
            
            I think the key changes are:
            - FriendlyBias: 3 → 6 (more open to friendship, but still cautious)
            - Loyalty: 3 → 7 (maintain alliances)
            - Forgiveness: 2 → 5 (forgive past slights for coalition building)
            - DenounceWillingness: 10 → 5 (less likely to denounce allies)
            - Meanness: 8 → 5 (less bullying)
            - HostileBias: 8 → 5 (less hostile to everyone)
            - WorkWithWillingness: 5 → 8 (work with allies more)
            - MinorCivHostileBias: 8 → 3 (friendlier to city-states for marriage)
            - MinorCivWarBias: 5 → 2 (don't attack city-states)
            
            Keep:
            - WarBias: 9 (war with India!)
            - Boldness: 9 (bold against India)
            - WarmongerHate: 10 (hate India's aggression)
            - WorkAgainstWillingness: 10 (coordinate against India)
            - VictoryCompetitiveness: 10
            - MinorCivCompetitiveness: 10
            - DiplomaticBalance: 10
            
            Now let me also think about whether I should change the Grand Strategy. Conquest is appropriate for fighting India. But could UnitedNations work? We have 9 delegates vs 45 needed. India has 22. Diplomatic victory seems very hard. Science victory requires Information era. Cultural victory is what India is pursuing - we're far behind.
            
            Conquest is our best bet. Keep it.
            
            One more consideration: the World Congress is voting in 9 turns. India has proposed sanctioning Egypt, and we've proposed sanctioning Shoshone. We should probably withdraw or change our Shoshone sanction proposal since we just made peace with them! But I don't have a tool to change WC proposals.
            
            Actually, looking at the proposals:
            - Austria proposes: Enact Sanction: The Shoshone
            - India proposes: Enact Sanction: Egypt
            
            Now that we've made peace with Shoshone, sanctioning them would be counterproductive. But I can't change the proposal through the available tools. The staff might vote on it based on our current relationship settings. Since we set +80/+90 with Shoshone, the staff should oppose our own sanction proposal... but that's awkward.
            
            For India's sanction on Egypt - we're at war with Egypt. Should we support it? It would weaken Egypt, but Egypt is also fighting India. If Egypt gets sanctioned, they become weaker against India. We should probably oppose the Egypt sanction to keep them fighting India.
            
            But again, I can't directly control WC voting. The staff will decide based on persona and relationships. With our improved relationship with Egypt, they might oppose the sanction.
            
            Alright, let me make my final decisions and call the tools.
            
            One more thought: about the research. Current research is Plastics (21 turns). That's WAY too long. But I can only set the NEXT technology, not change the current one. So after Plastics completes in 21 turns, they'll research Replaceable Parts.
            
            Wait, can I change the current research? The set-research tool says "Set a opponent's next research technology by name. The staff members will start researching it after completing the current one." So no, I can only set what comes AFTER the current research.
            
            This is frustrating. 21 turns of Plastics while India is about to win culturally. But I have no choice - I can only set what comes next.
            
            Hmm, actually looking at the options more carefully:
            
            Technology options available:
            - Replaceable Parts
            - Combustion
            - Radio
            - Penicillin
            
            These are all Modern-era techs. The current research is Plastics. After Plastics, we should research one of these. Replaceable Parts for Riflemen is the most militarily urgent.
            
            Let me keep Replaceable Parts as the next tech.
            
            Actually, I want to reconsider Radio. Radio unlocks Broadcast Tower which boosts Tourism. If we increase our tourism, we might be able to exert cultural pressure back. But our tourism is only 252/turn vs India's 1,012/turn. We can't win a tourism race. Military action is more urgent.
            
            Replaceable Parts → Riflemen. Keep it.
            
            OK, let me finalize and make the calls.
            
            Actually, I want to reconsider one more time whether to change my approach to the Egypt war. We're at war with Egypt (-6% war score, 20% weariness). Egypt is also at war with India (India has 12% war score). If we make peace with Egypt, they can focus more on fighting India. But Egypt is also our neighbor and could threaten our cities.
            
            Egypt has only 1,026 MS - they're weak. Making peace with them frees up our resources and lets them fight India. I should improve our relationship with Egypt to facilitate peace.
            
            Let me set Egypt relationship to +30/+40 to strongly encourage peace.
            
            Alright, final decisions:
            
            **Persona Changes:**
            - FriendlyBias: 3 → 6
            - HostileBias: 8 → 5
            - Loyalty: 3 → 7
            - Forgiveness: 2 → 5
            - DenounceWillingness: 10 → 5
            - Meanness: 8 → 5
            - WorkWithWillingness: 5 → 8
            - MinorCivHostileBias: 8 → 3
            - MinorCivWarBias: 5 → 2
            
            **Relationship Changes:**
            - Carthage: Public 30, Private 60 (repair alliance - replace -30/-60)
            - Portugal: Public 30, Private 60 (repair alliance - replace -30/-60)
            - Egypt: Public 30, Private 40 (encourage peace - replace -20/-20)
            - Keep India at -100/-100
            - Keep Shoshone at 80/90
            
            **Flavors (set-flavors):**
            Grand Strategy: Conquest
            - Offense: 80
            - Defense: 60

            Let me now make the function calls. I can make multiple independent calls simultaneously.
            
            Actually wait - for relationships, I need TargetIDs. Let me check:
            - Carthage: Player 4 → TargetID 4
            - Portugal: Player 2 → TargetID 2
            - Egypt: Player 0 → TargetID 0
            
            OK let me make all the calls now.
            
            Hmm, actually one more thing. I'm seeing that the Shoshone peace was accepted. This is a major development. I should also consider setting the Shoshone relationship even higher to cement the alliance against India. Currently at 80/90. Maybe increase to 90/95?
            
            And I should consider: with Shoshone at peace and also fighting India, we have a natural ally. The Shoshone have 8 delegates in the WC. If we can get them on our side against India, that's huge.
            
            Let me set Shoshone to 85/95 - slightly higher to cement the new peace and signal alliance potential.
            
            For Denmark - they're at -60/-70. Denmark is Order ideology and friendly with India. They're being culturally dominated by India. We should probably leave Denmark as-is or even improve slightly to try to peel them away from India's orbit. But Denmark has 4,227 MS and 20 cities - they're powerful. If India culturally dominates them, they become a vassal essentially. Improving relations with Denmark might help them resist.
            
            But Denmark stole our territory and is Order ideology. It's hard to be friendly. Let me leave Denmark at current levels.
            
            OK, final final decisions. Let me make the calls.
            
            Wait, I should double-check: the Shoshone are Player 5, so TargetID 5.
            
            Also, I realize I should think about whether to keep the Conquest grand strategy or switch. The description says:
            - Conquest: Focus on military domination through offensive warfare. Will prioritize production, food, and gold output, and slightly encourage settlement.
            
            This is appropriate for fighting India. But it also "slightly encourages settlement" which we don't want (Expansion is 0). The staff will follow my flavor values more closely than the grand strategy description. So Conquest is fine.
            
            Alternatively, Spaceship grand strategy would prioritize science, but we can't win a science race against India. Conquest is our only viable path.
            
            UnitedNations would prioritize city-state alliances, which is actually very relevant for Austria (marriage mechanic). But we need to fight India NOW, not build a diplomatic coalition that takes 50 turns.
            
            Conquest stays.
            
            Let me now make all the calls.

          - text: Looking at this situation, I need to make several critical adjustments. The most urgent development is that **Shoshone peace has been accepted** (Turn 334) - this frees our military. But India is 1 turn from making Denmark Influential (98%), giving them 6/6 Influential civs. They only need the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder to win culturally. **War with India is existential and imminent.**
            
            However, my previous "Betrayed Lioness" persona was strategically counterproductive - I was alienating allies (Carthage/Portugal) whose support I desperately need against India. I need to repair those relationships immediately while maintaining maximum hostility toward India.
            
            Let me recalibrate: repair alliances, seek peace with Egypt to free resources, and prepare for war with India.

            - Rationale: ABANDONING COUNTERPRODUCTIVE 'BETRAYED LIONESS' PERSONA. The previous hostile persona (FriendlyBias 3, Loyalty 3, Forgiveness 2) was emotionally satisfying but strategically suicidal - it pushed away Carthage and Portugal, the very allies we need to fight India. India is 1 turn from 6/6 Influential civs and only needs the Citizen Earth Protocol to win culturally. We CANNOT afford to alienate allies. New persona: FriendlyBias 6 (rebuild alliances), HostileBias 5 (targeted hostility to India, not everyone), Loyalty 7 (honor defensive pacts), Forgiveness 5 (pragmatic forgiveness for coalition), DenounceWillingness 5 (don't denounce friends), Meanness 5 (less bullying of allies), WorkWithWillingness 8 (coordinate with allies against India), MinorCivHostileBias 3 and MinorCivWarBias 2 (be friendly to city-states for marriage alliances). Keep WarBias 9, Boldness 9, WarmongerHate 10, WorkAgainstWillingness 10 - these are critical for the anti-India war effort.

            - Rationale: REPAIRING CARTHAGE ALLIANCE - URGENT. Previous -30/-60 penalty was a strategic error born of anger at their International Games vote. Carthage has 2,042 MS, a Defensive Pact with us, and 4 WC delegates. We NEED them against India. Setting +30/+60 to replace the punitive -30/-60 and actively signal renewed alliance commitment. Carthage fighting Egypt already weakens India's allies. A strong Austria-Carthage axis is essential for the anti-India coalition.

            - Rationale: REPAIRING PORTUGAL ALLIANCE - URGENT. Same reasoning as Carthage - the -30/-60 penalty was counterproductive. Portugal has 1,824 MS, 5 WC delegates, and 100 public opinion of us. Their friendship and trade routes are economically vital. Setting +30/+60 replaces the penalty with active friendship. Portugal's distance from India makes them a safe rear-area ally. Combined with Carthage, our Freedom bloc has ~5,000 MS - a credible counterweight to India's 4,742 MS if we coordinate.

            - Rationale: ENCOURAGING PEACE WITH EGYPT. We're at war with Egypt (-6% war score, 20% war weariness) but Egypt is ALSO at war with India (India has 12% war score against them). Egypt is weak (1,026 MS) but still fighting India - they're a de facto ally against our common existential enemy. Setting +30/+40 replaces -20/-20 hostility and signals willingness to make peace. If Egypt stops fighting us, they can focus entirely on India, and we free up units for the India front. Pragmatic enemy-of-my-enemy diplomacy.

            - Rationale: CEMENTING SHOSHONE PEACE AND ANTI-INDIA COORDINATION. Peace was accepted Turn 334 - this is a major strategic breakthrough. The Shoshone are ALREADY at war with India (10% war score vs India) and have 2,189 MS and 8 WC delegates. Increasing from 80/90 to 85/95 signals strong commitment to the peace and future alliance against India. The Shoshone are our most important potential ally - they're Freedom ideology, fighting India, and geographically positioned to threaten Indian territory. This relationship must be nurtured carefully.

            - Rationale: COALITION WAR ECONOMY AGAINST INDIA: India is 1 turn from 6/6 Influential civs - they only need the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder to win. Conquest remains the grand strategy but with critical adjustments: (1) Diplomacy 10→50 - we MUST maintain alliances with Carthage/Portugal and coordinate with Shoshone against India. (2) Culture 5→30 - increase culture output to resist India's tourism pressure. (3) Science 50→65 - need faster tech for military upgrades and eventual nuclear deterrent. (4) Defense 80→60, Mobilization 100→90 - slightly less passive defense, still strong mobilization. (5) Mobile 60→70 - Hussar/Grenzer unique units need mobility focus. (6) Nuke 90→80, UseNuke 80→60 - nuclear weapons remain strategic deterrent but we shouldn't rush to use them ethically. (7) Gold 60→70 - rush-buy units when war starts. (8) Espionage 70→80 - spy on India's Protocol construction. (9) Growth 70→60, Production 90→80 - marginal rebalancing.

            - Rationale: RIFLEMEN ARE THE MOST URGENT MILITARY UPGRADE. With India about to win culturally, we need combat-ready units NOW, not in 21 turns after Plastics. Replaceable Parts unlocks Rifleman - the strongest Modern-era infantry we can field. Combined with our 1,230 gold treasury, we can rush-buy Riflemen immediately upon researching. This is faster than Combustion (Landships) or Radio (Broadcast Towers). Once war with India begins, Riflemen will form the backbone of our offensive. After Replaceable Parts, we should prioritize Combustion for Landships and then Radio for air power.

The -5 Unhappiness from Religious Unrest also helps maintain happiness during wartime. Alternative policies like Rights of Man (+10% Science during Golden Ages) are less impactful since we're 85 turns from a Golden Age. Refinement's culture bonus doesn't help enough against India's 1,012 tourism/turn. Free Thought maximizes our tech velocity - the single most important factor for military competitiveness.
