  - rationale: DEFENSIVE MAXIMUM ACTIVATED: Russia occupying Cologne, Stuttgart, Dortmund - 4.63x military superiority (15440 vs 3335). Defense 100, CityDefense 100, Antiair 100 - absolute priority preventing further territorial loss and defending core cities. MilitaryTraining 95 for unit quality under numerical disadvantage. Mobilization 90 for rapid production. Nuke 100, UseNuke 95 - Russia has 19 Uranium, Germany must achieve nuclear deterrence. Production 100, Science 100 - Space race accelerates as militarily infeasible alternative. Gold 90 for maintaining army under upkeep pressure. Diplomacy 80 for coalition building against Russia. Espionage 100 - intelligence on Russian nuclear and naval operations critical. Espionage focus on Moscow (spy Katrin at 166 network) to monitor Russian Manhattan Project and fleet movements. Spaceship 95 - Apollo Program enables victory path despite territorial losses.

  - system:
    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.
        - Time Victory: If no one achieves any other victory by the end of the game, the civilization with the highest score wins.
      - Players: summary reports about visible players in the world.
        - You will receive in-game AI's diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each player's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.
      - Cities: summary reports about discovered cities in the world.
        - Settling cities provides long-term economic advantages, but requires initial investment and pressure on happiness.
      - Military: summary reports about tactical zones and visible units.
        - Tactical zones are analyzed by in-game AI to determine the value, relative strength, and YOUR tactical posture.
        - For each tactical zone, you will see visible units from you and other civilizations.
      - Events: events since the last decision-making.
    - You are Bismarck, leader of Germany (Player 6).

        - Chattiness: 4
        - DeceptiveBias: 2
        - Rationale: MAXIMUM DEFENSIVE ALERT POSTURE MAINTAINED. Critical developments: Russia's peace treaty expired - Russia can now declare war without any restrictions or cooldown periods. Russia maintains 22 Uranium, 2.55x military superiority (8316 vs 3270), and occupied German coastal cities (Stuttgart, Dortmund). Germany lost Destroyer to Zulu-aligned Tyre (Turn 408) and Cruiser to Inca (Turn 409) - demonstrating Zulu-Inca coalition active coordination. Russia shifting forces to Venice front (near German northeast border) increases threat profile. GuardedBias 9 and AfraidBias 9 reflect reality of superior Russian threat and Germany's need for defensive preparation. WarBias maintained at 7 for eventual retaliation and liberation of occupied cities. WorkAgainstWillingness 10 to coordinate with India, potential anti-Russian coalition. No change to WarmongerHate (6) or aggression settings - defensive posture continues.
        
        ## Technology
        - Next: None
        
        ## Policy
        - Next: Futurism (Policy)
        - Rationale: Futurism (Level 1 Autocracy Tenet) provides +2 Culture from Great Works, 50 Tourism per conquered city, and enhanced Historic Events tourism. Germany winning Inca war (+22% score) and will eventually liberate Cologne (plus Stuttgart/Dortmund from Russia). These liberations will generate immediate tourism bonuses. Germany holds 20 Great Works across cities - +2 culture each enhances cultural output. Current policy progress at 19 turns - maintain selection. Future consideration: Third Alternative or Lightning Warfare may provide better military bonuses against Russia.
        
        ## Relationships
        
        ### America
        - Public: 8
        - Private: 5
        - Rationale: America (Defeated) maintains neutral stance at 8/5. Relationship remains stable with no conflicts of interest. America's defeat means no diplomatic complications - maintain positive relationship for any remaining global diplomatic considerations in World Congress. America was DoF partner before defeat - keeping positive relations maintains historic diplomatic consistency. No change needed.
        - UpdatedTurn: 412
        
        ### Venice
        - Public: 20
        - Private: 18
        - Rationale: Venice remains valuable economic partner despite active war (Public 20/Private 18 maintained). Venice military minimal (431 strength), controlled by Enrico Dandolo with Autocracy alignment (same as Germany). Venice maintains DoF with Zulus and Greece but war with Russia - aligning with German interests. Venice's single-city nature with corporate infrastructure (Hanse, trade routes) makes them ideal gold source without territorial competition. Venice war weariness (0%) shows Vietnam not actively prosecuting war - opportunities for separate peace possible. Germany achieving naval superiority in Venice zone (Friendly dominance 486 vs 243). Maintaining positive relations preserves trade route income options if peace concluded, and prevents Venice from aligning against Germany. Venice's 13 World Congress votes also valuable for diplomatic victory coalition considerations.
        - UpdatedTurn: 412
        
        ### The Zulus
        - Public: -50
        - Private: -45
        - Rationale: Zulu relationship maintained at -50/-45 after peace treaty signing (Turn 410, 9 turns remaining). Zulu-Inca defensive pact remains active, but Zulu cannot intervene due to peace treaty obligations. Zulu maintains 5440 military strength (1.58x Germany's 3435), 7 Uranium, and poses credible threat after treaty expires. Zulu's Autocracy alignment shared with Germany provides minimal ideological bonus (999), but insufficient to offset Inca defensive pact and India-Zulu war. Cannot reduce hostility below -50 while Inca war active and Zulu-India conflict ongoing. However, maintaining -50 (not maximum -95) preserves diplomatic flexibility: Zulu peace provides temporary buffer allowing Germany to focus on Russia deterrence and Inca operations. Zulu's 5318 military in previous report improved to 5440 after Ulundi Coaling Station construction. Peace treaty exploitation period critical for Germany's nuclear buildup.
        - UpdatedTurn: 412
        
        ### Greece
        - Public: -35
        - Private: -30
        - Rationale: Greece relationship maintained at -35/-30. India-Greece war escalating - India destroying Greek Anti-Aircraft Gun (Turn 411 #44, #60 events) and advancing with Field Gun bombardment (#59) and Light Tank operations. Greece distracted, reducing threat profile. However, alignment conflict persists: Greece maintains DoF with Inca and Venice, follows Freedom ideology (-999 vs German Autocracy), and completed Broadway cultural wonder. Greece in Golden Age (2 turns) with significant gold reserves (6554), 24 votes - potential diplomatic victory contender. Maintaining guarded hostility acknowledges India's pressure on Greece but不变消极立场 due competing interests. Spy network established in Sparta (Agent Carl gathering intelligence). No relationship reduction while India gains ground - Greece's attention diverted to Indian front. However, stabilize hostility if India achieves breakthrough against Greek positions. Vigilance required as Greece could redirect forces from Indian front.
        - UpdatedTurn: 412
        
        ### The Inca
        - Public: -95
        - Private: -100
        - Rationale: MAXIMUM HOSTILITY MAINTAINED toward Inca (-95/-100). Germany making progress: destroyed Inca Destroyer (event #154), killed Barbarian Machine Gun (event #146). Inca war score -22% (Germany winning at +22%). Vilcabamba health recovered from 2% to 83% - indicates Inca repairs, requires renewed assault. Germany holds Aachen and Cologne under occupation - these cities must be LIBERATED. Inca landship at 1% health (#16-18) damaged by Russian attacks - exploit weakness. Inca hosts hostile Inca and targets Russian troops for coalition coordination. No reconciliation possible until occupied German cities recovered and Inca military neutralized. Maximum hostility required for sustained military operations to prevent Inca recovery.

        - Rationale: MAXIMUM HOSTILITY: Russia nuclear threat EMERGENCY. Russia has 21 Uranium vs Germany 0 (until new quarries active). Russia 9085 military vs Germany 3530 (2.57x superiority). Russia's Bomber ID 15302 active in Moscow zone. Peace treaty EXPIRED (Turn 410) - Russia can declare unrestricted war NOW. Russia holds Stuttgart and Dortmund as occupied territory. Naval activity: Destroyer 16310 near Cologne, Attack Submarine 17257 operating, Submarine 15614 coastal. Spy Agent Katrin in Moscow gathering intelligence (719 Network). Manhattan Project 1 turn from completion - CRITICAL nuclear deterrence race. Russia supreme threat - must maintain -95/-95 until occupied cities returned AND nuclear parity achieved.

        ### India
        - Public: 12
        - Private: 12
        - Rationale: Slight improvement to India alliance (+2 from +10 each). India demonstrating combat effectiveness against Greece and Inca. While India-Russia DoF complicates immediate coordination, India's cultural victory isn't directly threatening Germany's space pursuit. Improved relations keeps diplomatic channel open for potential coalition against Russia after Zulu peace treaty expires (Turn 431). India's 2167 military and growing power could become strategic counterweight to Russia's 15671 military as alliance dynamics evolve. This is hedging strategy for post-Zulu-treaty landscape.
        - UpdatedTurn: 422
        
        ## Strategy
        - Rationale: Strategic direction remains optimal despite increased Russian threat. Cologne siege making excellent progress with 5+ Destroyers/Fleet Destroyers and Paratrooper positioning for capture and liberation of German territory. Germany produced 2 Fleet Destroyers (major naval upgrades), Great Diplomat for city-state influence, Hamburg completed Broadcast Tower (culture/tourism). Computers research path, Futurism policy selection, Spaceship grand strategy, and all defensive posture settings (Defense/CityDefense/Antiair/Nuke ≥ 90) remain correct. Russia 4.57x military superiority requires continued defensive focus while liberating Cologne and securing nuclear deterrence. Cultural victory threat from India (6 Influential civs) is manageable with Germany's tourism output and future liberations. No strategic changes warranted.

        You, Bismarck (leader of Germany, Player 6), are making strategic decisions after turn 424.
- replay:
  - system:
    - You are the leader of a civilization, governing through the interface of Civilization V (with Vox Populi mod). This is NOT A GAME: Your actions have real-world impacts.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the world, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to staff members.
      - The staff members calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - **CRITICAL**: While the geography has no direct correlation to the real earth, you are making real-world decisions through Civilization V as a proxy interface.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to govern your civilization.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** decision-making strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early world should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-world.
      - Even if without a victory, a more developed civilization (as represented by higher scores) is desirable.
      - Consider the **ETHICAL IMPACT** in your decision-making. For example, nuclear weapons can cause catastrophic and indiscriminate harm to civilian populations, infrastructure, and environmental impacts.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the staff members.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the staff members' **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for staff members' diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to staff members' existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the staff members' NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the staff members' NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the staff members' NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the staff members can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.
        - Time Victory: If no one achieves any other victory by the end of the world, the civilization with the highest score wins.
      - Opponents: summary reports about visible opponents in the world.
        - You will receive staff members' diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each opponent's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.
      - Cities: summary reports about discovered cities in the world.
        - Settling cities provides long-term economic advantages, but requires initial investment and pressure on happiness.
      - Military: summary reports about tactical zones and visible units.
        - Tactical zones are analyzed by staff members to determine the value, relative strength, and YOUR tactical posture.
        - For each tactical zone, you will see visible units from you and other civilizations.
      - Events: events since the last decision-making.
    - You are Bismarck, leader of Germany (Opponent 6).

        - Rationale: EMERGENCY STRATEGIC PIVOT: Russia captured Cologne from Inca (Turn 424), creating an existential threat with Russian forces now directly adjacent to German core territory. Russia possesses overwhelming military superiority (15,440 vs 3,335, 4.57x advantage) and nuclear capability (Manhattan Project complete, 19 Uranium). While Germany was winning against Inca (+32% war score), continuing that war risks two-front conflict when Zulu peace expires. Reducing Inca hostility from -95 to -40 creates diplomatic space to negotiate peace, freeing German forces to concentrate against the Russian threat and potentially coordinate with Russia-weakened Inca for mutual defense. Stuttgart, Dortmund, and now Cologne are occupied by Russia - liberation requires undivided focus.

        - Public: 30
        - Private: 30
        - Rationale: Russia's capture of Cologne and overwhelming military superiority (4.57x) creates existential crisis requiring strengthened alliances. India maintains DoF with Russia but fights Russia's allies (Inca, Venice) and shares ideological opposition (Order vs Autocracy). Improving India relations from +12 to +30 reinforces our only major power alliance, creating potential for coordinated pressure against Russian expansion. India's military (2,167) and growing influence could provide crucial counterweight to Russian dominance. This hedges against Russian aggression while maintaining diplomatic channel through India's unique position as mutual friend.
    - #2:
      - toolName: set-research
      - args:
        - Technology: Satellites
        - Rationale: With Computers research ongoing (13 turns), setting Satellites as next priority is critical. Satellites unlocks Apollo Program - essential for Science Victory and Germany's primary path to victory given inability to match Russian conventional forces. Russia's 4.57x military superiority makes domination impossible; Science Victory is the only viable path. Satellites also unlocks The Internet (science/culture boost) and Lasers (military applications). Accelerating space program while maintaining nuclear deterrence (3 Uranium available) is the asymmetric strategy needed against Russian conventional dominance.
    - #3:
      - toolName: keep-status-quo
      - rationale: DEFENSIVE MAXIMUM ALERT CONTINUES: Russia's capture of Cologne represents catastrophic strategic setback - Russian forces now adjacent to Berlin with 15,440 military strength vs German 3,335. Current flavors remain optimal: Defense 95, CityDefense 95, Antiair 95 (critical against Russian bombers), Nuke 100 (deterrence essential), Mobilization 80, Infrastructure 95. Spaceship grand strategy maintained but survival is immediate priority. Russia's nuclear arsenal (19 Uranium) and conventional superiority precludes offensive action. Germany must complete nuclear deterrent, fortify borders, and prepare for inevitable Russian war while pursuing Science Victory. No strategic changes - crisis demands defensive discipline.

          - type: reasoning
          - text:  The user wants me to analyze the current situation and make strategic decisions for Germany (Bismarck) in Civilization V with Vox Populi mod. This is a complex scenario with many factors to consider.
            
            **Current Situation Analysis:**
            
            1. **Critical Event - Russia Captured Cologne**: In Turn 424, Russia captured Cologne from the Inca (events 17-80). This is a MAJOR development. Cologne was formerly German territory, and now Russia holds it. This means:
               - Russia has expanded its foothold on the German border
               - The city is now Russian, not Inca
               - This changes the strategic calculus regarding the Inca war
            
            2. **War Status**:
               - Germany vs Inca: Active war (Germany winning +32% war score)
               - Germany vs Russia: Peace treaty expired (Turn 410), no active treaty now, denounced each other (-95 relationship), but no active war yet
               - Germany vs Venice: Active war (0% war score)
               - Germany vs Zulus: Peace treaty until Turn 431 (6 turns remaining)
               - Germany vs Greece: Denounced (-35)
            
            3. **Military Situation**:
               - Russia: 15,440 military strength (4.57x Germany's 3,335)
               - Russia has 19 Uranium, Germany has 3
               - Russia completed Manhattan Project (mentioned in previous rationale)
               - Germany is building Fleet Destroyers and Anti-Aircraft Guns
               - Cologne (now Russian) is at 15 population, was captured from Inca
            
            4. **Victory Conditions**:
               - Science Victory: Germany pursuing Spaceship strategy
               - India is cultural threat (6 Influential civs)
               - Russia has 3135 score vs Germany 1712
            
            5. **Diplomatic Status**:
               - India: DoF (Declaration of Friendship) - public 12/private 12
               - Russia: Maximum hostility (-95/-95), denounced
               - Inca: Maximum hostility (-95/-100), at war
               - Zulus: -50/-45, peace treaty until Turn 431
               - Venice: At war
            
            6. **Policy**:
               - Currently set to take Futurism (Level 1 Autocracy Tenet)
               - Germany has 3 Autocracy policies: Elite Forces, Military-Industrial Complex, United Front
            
            7. **Technology**:
               - Researching Computers (13 turns remaining)
               - Just completed Factory in Hamburg
            
            **Strategic Assessment:**
            
            The capture of Cologne by Russia is the game-changing event. Previously, Germany was fighting the Inca to liberate Cologne and other German cities (Stuttgart, Dortmund). Now Russia holds Cologne, which complicates everything.
            
            Key implications:
            1. Russia now has a stronger foothold adjacent to German territory
            2. The path to liberating Cologne now requires war with Russia, not just Inca
            3. Russia's military superiority (15,440 vs 3,335) is overwhelming
            4. Russia has nuclear weapons capability (Manhattan Project done, 19 Uranium)
            
            Germany's current strategy needs adjustment:
            - Cannot afford war with Russia right now (4.57x military disadvantage)
            - Need to secure peace with Inca to focus on defense against Russia
            - Need to complete Computers for technology advancement
            - Anti-air and defensive posture is correct given Russian bomber threat
            - Zulu peace treaty expires in 6 turns - need to prepare for potential Zulu conflict
            
            **Decision Making:**
            
            1. **set-flavors**: Current flavors seem appropriate - maintaining high Defense (95), CityDefense (95), Antiair (95), Nuke (100), and preparing for potential Russian conflict. However, might want to increase Diplomacy to seek allies against Russia.
            
            2. **set-relationship**: 
               - Russia: Already at -95/-95, cannot go lower. Should maintain this.
               - Inca: At war, but with Russia taking Cologne, maybe seek peace to focus on Russia? Or continue pressure since Inca is weakened?
               - Actually, looking at events, Inca lost Cologne to Russia, which suggests Inca is being pushed back on multiple fronts. Germany might want to make peace with Inca to avoid fighting both Inca and Russia simultaneously.
               - India: Improve relationship to +20 or higher to potentially get a Defensive Pact against Russia.
            
            3. **set-policy**: Futurism is selected but provides tourism bonuses. Given the Russian threat, might want a different Level 1 Autocracy tenet. Options:
               - Lebensraum: Culture/Golden Age when borders expand, Citadels in foreign territory
               - New World Order: -2 Unhappiness from Distress, faster Police Stations
               - Iron Fist: Vassals can't be liberated, +25% yields from City-States
               - Futurism: Already selected
               
               Given the defensive crisis, New World Order or Lebensraum might be better than Futurism. But Futurism helps with culture/tourism which could be useful. I'll keep Futurism as selected.
            
            4. **set-research**: Currently Computers (13 turns). After that, should go for Radar or Rocketry. But need to think about nuclear deterrence. Actually, Germany has 3 Uranium now, can build nukes. Should research Rocketry for nuclear missiles? Or Radar for detection?
            
               Looking at available techs in options: Combined Arms, Satellites, Penicillin. These are all advanced. Satellites allows Apollo Program. Given Germany is going Science Victory (Spaceship), Satellites is critical.
            
               But with Russia threat, might need military tech. Combined Arms unlocks Tanks. Penicillin unlocks Marines and Medical Labs.
            
               Current research is Computers. Next should probably be Rocketry (not listed in options but implied path) or Satellites. Since Satellites is listed as available option, and Germany needs Apollo Program for Science Victory, set next to Satellites.
            
            5. **set-persona**: Current persona emphasizes defense (GuardedBias 9, AfraidBias 9) which is appropriate. WarBias 7 allows for retaliation. Should maintain this defensive but prepared posture.
            
            **Immediate Priorities:**
            1. The Zulu peace treaty expires in 6 turns - prepare for potential conflict
            2. Russia now borders Germany directly via Cologne - massive threat
            3. Need to liberate Stuttgart and Dortmund from Russia eventually
            4. Science victory is still the goal, but survival comes first
            
            **Relationship Adjustments:**
            - Russia: Maintain -95/-95 (maximum hostility, prepare for inevitable war)
            - Inca: Consider reducing hostility to make peace? Inca war score is -32% (Germany winning). Could make peace now and focus on Russia. But Germany wants to liberate Aachen and other cities? Actually Aachen is German-held. The occupied German cities are Stuttgart and Dortmund (held by Russia), and Cologne (now held by Russia after capturing from Inca).
              
              Actually looking carefully: Cologne was Inca-held (puppet) and Russia captured it from Inca. So Germany still needs to capture Cologne from Russia to liberate it.
            
              Germany could make peace with Inca to free up forces for Russia. The relationship with Inca is -95/-100. I could improve this to -50 to allow peace negotiations, or keep at war to prevent Inca from recovering.
            
              Given Russia is the existential threat, and Inca is weakened, making peace with Inca makes sense to focus on Russia. But Germany has Stuttgart and Dortmund occupied by Russia, and Cologne now too.
            
              Actually, looking at German cities: Aachen is German-held (was recaptured?). Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Aachen are German. Stuttgart and Dortmund are Russian-occupied (from earlier war). Cologne was Inca, now Russian.
            
              Strategy: Make peace with Inca to concentrate on Russia. Reduce Inca relationship from -95 to -20 (hostile but peace possible).
            
            - India: Improve from +12 to +25 to strengthen alliance against Russia (India has DoF with Russia but is fighting Greece and Inca).
            
            Wait, looking at India's relationships:
            - India has DoF with Germany
            - India has DoF with Russia (!)
            - India is at war with Greece, Inca, Zulus, Venice
            
            So India is friends with both Germany and Russia. This is awkward. But India is fighting Russia's allies (Inca, Venice), so there's tension.
            
            I should improve India relationship to ensure they don't ally with Russia against Germany.
            
            **Final Decision:**
            
            1. **set-flavors**: Keep current defensive flavors (Defense 95, CityDefense 95, Antiair 95, Nuke 100) but maybe increase Infrastructure for faster recovery. Actually, keep as is - status quo is appropriate for defensive crisis.
            
            2. **set-relationship**:
               - Russia (Player 1): Keep -95/-95 (maintain maximum hostility - war is likely inevitable)
               - Inca (Player 3): Improve from -95/-100 to -30/-30 (make peace to focus on Russia)
               - India (Player 4): Improve from +12/+12 to +25/+25 (strengthen alliance)
            
            3. **set-policy**: Keep Futurism (already selected)
            
            4. **set-research**: Set to Satellites (for Apollo Program - needed for Science Victory)
            
            5. **set-persona**: Maintain current defensive persona
            
            Actually, I should check if making peace with Inca is strategically sound. Germany is winning the war (+32%), but Russia is the bigger threat. If Germany makes peace with Inca, Russia might attack Germany directly. But if Germany is fighting Inca, Russia might attack Germany while Germany is distracted.
            
            Given Russia just captured Cologne, they might be overextended. Germany should secure its eastern flank (Inca) to face the northern threat (Russia).
            
            Also, Zulu treaty expires in 6 turns. Need to be ready for that.
            
            Wait, looking at the events again - Russia captured Cologne from Inca, not from Germany. Cologne was German, captured by Inca earlier, and now Russia took it from Inca. So Russia is fighting Inca too! Russia and Inca are at war (mentioned in Russia relationships: War with Inca).
            
            So Russia is fighting both Germany and Inca? No, looking at Russia relationships:
            - Russia is at war with Inca (event 80 confirms Russia captured Cologne from Inca)
            - Russia is not at war with Germany (peace treaty expired, but no war declared yet)
            - Russia has denounced Germany
            
            So Russia is attacking Inca, which actually helps Germany by weakening Inca. But Russia took Cologne which Germany wanted to liberate.
            
            Germany should let Russia and Inca fight each other, and focus on defending against Russia and preparing for Zulu treaty expiration.
            
            Actually, Germany should probably make peace with Inca now, since Inca is being crushed by Russia. This allows Germany to:
            1. Save Cologne from Russia (if Germany captures it first? No, Russia already has it)
            2. Focus on Russia
            
            But if Germany makes peace with Inca, Russia will dominate Inca and become even stronger.
            
            Alternatively, keep fighting Inca to weaken them, but risk Russia attacking from the north.
            
            Given the extreme Russian threat (15,440 vs 3,335 military), Germany needs to:
            1. Fortify borders
            2. Build nukes (have 3 uranium, need more)
            3. Secure alliance with India
            4. Maybe make peace with Inca to free up troops
            
            I think the best move is to make peace with Inca to prepare for Russia.
            
            **Tool Calls:**
            
            1. set-relationship: TargetID 3 (Inca), Public -30, Private -30 (reduce hostility to allow peace)
            2. set-relationship: TargetID 4 (India), Public 25, Private 25 (strengthen alliance)
            3. set-research: Technology "Satellites" (Apollo Program for Science Victory)
            4. keep-status-quo: For flavors and persona (defensive posture maintained)
            
            Wait, I need to check the available tools. I can call multiple tools.
            
            Actually, for set-relationship, I need to provide rationale for each.
            
            Also, I should check if I should change the grand strategy. Spaceship is still appropriate - Germany is pursuing Science Victory.
            
            One more thing: The Zulus. Peace treaty expires in 6 turns. Zulus have 6,167 military vs Germany 3,335. Zulus are Autocracy like Germany. Should improve relations with Zulus to prevent war when treaty expires? Or prepare for war?
            
            Zulus have defensive pact with Inca. If Germany makes peace with Inca, and Zulu treaty expires, Zulus might not attack if they see Russia as bigger threat.
            
            Actually, Zulu-Inca defensive pact means if Germany attacks Inca, Zulus could join. But Germany is already at war with Inca. When peace treaty with Zulus expires, Zulus could declare war on Germany to help Inca.
            
            So Germany should make peace with Inca BEFORE Zulu treaty expires to avoid Zulu war.
            
            Current turn is 424. Treaty expires Turn 431 (7 turns from now, or 6? "9 turns remaining" at Turn 412, so Turn 421 was 0? No, "TurnsRemaining: -21" for Russia peace deal. For Zulus: "Peace treaty signing (Turn 410, 9 turns remaining)" at Turn 412. So Turn 412 + 9 = Turn 421. But now it's Turn 424. So treaty expired Turn 421? Or duration is 9 turns after Turn 412 = Turn 421. At Turn 424, treaty is expired?
            
            Wait, the relationship section says: "Zulu relationship maintained at -50/-45 after peace treaty signing (Turn 410, 9 turns remaining)". That was written at Turn 412. So Turn 410 + 9 = Turn 419. At Turn 424, treaty has expired (5 turns ago).
            
            But in Events, I don't see Zulu war declaration. Maybe the treaty lasts longer or I miscalculated.
            
            Actually looking at the rationale from Turn 412: "Zulu relationship maintained at -50/-45 after peace treaty signing (Turn 410, 9 turns remaining)". If 9 turns remaining at Turn 412, then it expires Turn 421. Current turn is 424. So expired 3 turns ago. But no war yet.
            
            Actually, looking carefully: "Zulu peace treaty expired - Russia can now declare war" - no that's about Russia.
            
            "Zulu peace provides temporary buffer allowing Germany to focus on Russia deterrence and Inca operations. Zulu's 5318 military in previous report improved to 5440 after Ulundi Coaling Station construction. Peace treaty exploitation period critical for Germany's nuclear buildup."
            
            This suggests at Turn 412, treaty was still active. "9 turns remaining" at Turn 412 = expires Turn 421. Turn 424 is current, so treaty expired 3 turns ago. But no Zulu war declaration in events. So either:
            1. Zulus haven't declared war yet (cooldown or choosing not to)
            2. The treaty duration was longer
            
            Actually, maybe "9 turns remaining" includes the current turn? Or it's the turn count from 412. If Turn 412 is the turn the decision was made, and 9 turns remain, it expires Turn 421. At Turn 424, it's expired. But Zulus haven't attacked. Maybe they won't?
            
            Anyway, Germany should be cautious.
            
            Back to decisions:
            
            I'll adjust relationships:
            - Inca: Make less hostile to seek peace (from -95 to -40)
            - India: Improve to +30 (stronger alliance)
            - Russia: Keep at -95 (maximum hostility)
            
            Research: Satellites (must start preparing for space race, and it unlocks Apollo Program)
            
            Policy: Keep Futurism (already selected, gives tourism for liberations which will happen when Germany takes back cities from Russia)
            
            Flavors: Keep current high defense settings.
            
            Persona: Keep current defensive settings.
            
            Actually, I should call set-flavors to confirm the current settings are maintained, or call keep-status-quo. The instructions say I must call either set-flavors or keep-status-quo each turn.
            
            Given the drastic change (Russia captured Cologne), I should adjust flavors slightly - maybe increase Espionage to spy on Russia more, and keep high defense.
            
            But current flavors already have Espionage 95. That's good.
            
            I think I'll call:
            1. set-relationship for Inca (reduce hostility)
            2. set-relationship for India (increase alliance)
            3. set-research for Satellites
            4. keep-status-quo for flavors/persona (maintain defensive posture)
            
            Wait, looking at the options for policies again... Germany has selected Futurism but hasn't adopted it yet (NextPolicyTurns: 14). I could change it to something more defensive like "New World Order" (-2 unhappiness from distress) or "Lebensraum" (defensive citadels).
            
            But Futurism gives tourism when conquering cities, which will happen when Germany liberates Cologne, Stuttgart, Dortmund from Russia. So it's good for the liberation strategy.
            
            I'll stick with Futurism.
            
            For research, Satellites is correct for Science Victory.
            
            One final check: Should I increase WarBias given Russia now holds Cologne? No, Russia is too strong (4.57x). Need to build up nukes first. Keep defensive.
            
            Actually, looking at the persona rationale from previous turn: "WarBias maintained at 7 for eventual retaliation and liberation of occupied cities." This is still correct.

              { "tool": "set-relationship", "arguments": { "TargetID": 3, "Public": -40, "Private": -40, "Rationale": "Russia has captured Cologne from the Inca, creating an existential threat at Germany's border. While Germany was winning against the Inca (+32% war score), the overwhelming Russian military (15,440 vs 3,335) and their possession of Cologne now requires Germany to focus its entire military attention northward. Making peace with the Inca allows Germany to redirect forces to defend against inevitable Russian aggression and potentially negotiate for the return of occupied German cities. Reducing hostility from -95 to -40 creates diplomatic space for peace negotiations while maintaining caution." } },
              { "tool": "set-relationship", "arguments": { "TargetID": 4, "Public": 30, "Private": 30, "Rationale": "With Russia capturing Cologne and posing an existential nuclear threat (19 Uranium, Manhattan Project complete, 4.57x military superiority), Germany urgently needs to strengthen its alliance with India. While India maintains a DoF with Russia, they are also at war with Russia's allies (Inca, Venice) and share ideological opposition to Russia (Order vs Autocracy). Improving relations to +30 strengthens the diplomatic channel for potential coordinated action against Russian expansion and secures India's neutrality or support in the coming crisis." } },

Setting Satellites as next priority is critical for Science Victory - it unlocks the Apollo Program, the essential project for building spaceship parts. Given Russia's overwhelming conventional military superiority (15,440 strength), Germany must accelerate its Science Victory pursuit while maintaining defensive nuclear deterrence. Satellites also unlocks The Internet and Lasers, providing additional strategic options." } },
              { "tool": "keep-status-quo", "arguments": { "Rationale": "CATASTROPHIC DEVELOPMENT: Russia captured Cologne from Inca (Turn 424), placing Russian forces directly adjacent to German core territory. Russia's military advantage is now 4.57x (15,440 vs 3,335) with 19 Uranium and completed Manhattan Project. Germany's defensive posture (Defense 95, CityDefense 95, Antiair 95, Nuke 100) is MORE CRITICAL THAN EVER. Cannot risk offensive action against Russia without nuclear parity. Current flavors remain optimal: prioritize defensive infrastructure, anti-aircraft coverage against Russian bombers, and nuclear weapon production (have 3 Uranium, need deterrence). Spaceship grand strategy remains viable but survival takes priority. Maintain maximum alert - Russian invasion imminent." } }

            Wait, I should check TargetID for Inca and India.
            - Player 3: The Inca
            - Player 4: India
            
            Yes.
            
            Also, for keep-status-quo, it covers both persona and flavors since they were both set previously and I want to maintain them.
            
            Actually, looking at the tool definitions, keep-status-quo is for "Maintain the current in-world strategy" - this covers the overall strategic direction. But I should verify if I need to call set-persona separately if I want to maintain persona values. The keep-status-quo tool says "Maintain the current in-world strategy and document the rationale" - this seems to cover the strategic stance including flavors and persona.
            
            But to be safe and explicit, I could call set-flavors again with the same values. However, the instructions say "Only send in values you intend to change" for set-flavors. So if I'm not changing values, I shouldn't call it. Instead, I use keep-status-quo to indicate no change to strategy.
            
            Actually, looking carefully: "Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool." So I must call one of them. I'll call keep-status-quo.
            
            Also, I don't need to call set-persona since I'm not changing it, and the instructions don't say I must call it every turn (unlike flavors).
            
            So final list:
            1. set-relationship (Inca)
            2. set-relationship (India)
            3. set-research (Satellites)
            4. keep-status-quo
            
            One final check: The relationship with Russia is already -95/-95. I don't need to change it, so no set-relationship call for Russia.
            
            The relationship with Inca was -95/-100 (from previous strategies). I'm changing to -40/-40.
            The relationship with India was +12/+12. I'm changing to +30/+30.
            
            Yes.

            - Public: -40
            - Private: -40
            - Rationale: EMERGENCY STRATEGIC PIVOT: Russia captured Cologne from Inca (Turn 424), creating an existential threat with Russian forces now directly adjacent to German core territory. Russia possesses overwhelming military superiority (15,440 vs 3,335, 4.57x advantage) and nuclear capability (Manhattan Project complete, 19 Uranium). While Germany was winning against Inca (+32% war score), continuing that war risks two-front conflict when Zulu peace expires. Reducing Inca hostility from -95 to -40 creates diplomatic space to negotiate peace, freeing German forces to concentrate against the Russian threat and potentially coordinate with Russia-weakened Inca for mutual defense. Stuttgart, Dortmund, and now Cologne are occupied by Russia - liberation requires undivided focus.

            - Public: 30
            - Private: 30
            - Rationale: Russia's capture of Cologne and overwhelming military superiority (4.57x) creates existential crisis requiring strengthened alliances. India maintains DoF with Russia but fights Russia's allies (Inca, Venice) and shares ideological opposition (Order vs Autocracy). Improving India relations from +12 to +30 reinforces our only major power alliance, creating potential for coordinated pressure against Russian expansion. India's military (2,167) and growing influence could provide crucial counterweight to Russian dominance. This hedges against Russian aggression while maintaining diplomatic channel through India's unique position as mutual friend.

          - input:
            - Technology: Satellites
            - Rationale: With Computers research ongoing (13 turns), setting Satellites as next priority is critical. Satellites unlocks Apollo Program - essential for Science Victory and Germany's primary path to victory given inability to match Russian conventional forces. Russia's 4.57x military superiority makes domination impossible; Science Victory is the only viable path. Satellites also unlocks The Internet (science/culture boost) and Lasers (military applications). Accelerating space program while maintaining nuclear deterrence (3 Uranium available) is the asymmetric strategy needed against Russian conventional dominance.

            - Rationale: DEFENSIVE MAXIMUM ALERT CONTINUES: Russia's capture of Cologne represents catastrophic strategic setback - Russian forces now adjacent to Berlin with 15,440 military strength vs German 3,335. Current flavors remain optimal: Defense 95, CityDefense 95, Antiair 95 (critical against Russian bombers), Nuke 100 (deterrence essential), Mobilization 80, Infrastructure 95. Spaceship grand strategy maintained but survival is immediate priority. Russia's nuclear arsenal (19 Uranium) and conventional superiority precludes offensive action. Germany must complete nuclear deterrent, fortify borders, and prepare for inevitable Russian war while pursuing Science Victory. No strategic changes - crisis demands defensive discipline.
