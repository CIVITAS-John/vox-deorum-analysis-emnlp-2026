  - rationale: Turn 452: Critical survival situation - Byzantium at 40/44 delegates with World Congress voting in 1 turn. They just demonstrated nuclear aggression by nuking Madrid. Apollo Program completes next turn - must immediately pivot to maximum spaceship production. Increased Nuke flavor to 100 (from 95) and UseNuke to 95 (from 90) - need immediate nuclear deterrent capability given Byzantine nuclear attack and Mongol peace expiry. Production boosted to 95 (from 90) for rapid spaceship part construction after Apollo completes. GreatPeople to 85 for Great Engineer acquisition. All other priorities secondary to surviving long enough to complete science victory.

    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.
        - Time Victory: If no one achieves any other victory by the end of the game, the civilization with the highest score wins.
      - Players: summary reports about visible players in the world.
        - You will receive in-game AI's diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each player's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.
      - Cities: summary reports about discovered cities in the world.
        - Settling cities provides long-term economic advantages, but requires initial investment and pressure on happiness.
      - Military: summary reports about tactical zones and visible units.
        - Tactical zones are analyzed by in-game AI to determine the value, relative strength, and YOUR tactical posture.
        - For each tactical zone, you will see visible units from you and other civilizations.
      - Events: events since the last decision-making.
    - You are Washington, leader of America (Player 2).

        - Neediness: 8
        - Chattiness: 7
        - DeceptiveBias: 3
        - Rationale: Turn 443: Increasing DenounceWillingness from 7 to 8. Peace with Mongolia expires in 1 turn - they have started Manhattan Project and will almost certainly launch nuclear attack. Need to maintain maximum diplomatic pressure through denouncements. Byzantium at 93% of diplomatic victory - must escalate hostile diplomatic stance. WarBias remains 3 despite imminent conflict - still overwhelmingly outnumbered 11:1, must prioritize survival and infrastructure protection over offensive posture.
        
        ## Technology
        - Next: Lasers
        - Rationale: Turn 449: Lasers remains critical next research after Telecommunications completes. Unlocks Globalization and Particle Physics - both essential for Science Victory progression toward spaceship parts. Also provides Nuclear Missiles which may become necessary as deterrent against Byzantine/Mongol aggression. Mobile Tactics would offer Mechanized Infantry but offensive units not priority while defending against existential threats.
        
        ## Policy
        - Next: Spaceflight Pioneers (Policy)
        - Rationale: Turn 449: Spaceflight Pioneers (Order Tier 3 tenet) confirmed as next policy selection in 9 turns. Free Great Engineer and Great Scientist will be essential for rushing spaceship parts after Apollo Program completes in 4 turns. This is the only viable path to Science Victory before Byzantium secures diplomatic victory in upcoming World Congress sessions.
        
        ## Relationships
        
        ### Raqmu
        - Public: 40
        - Private: 40
        - Rationale: Reducing Raqmu from previous high priority to moderate positive relationship. Lost Ally status to Mongolia (39 influence vs our 35), and recovery is complicated by Mongolia's Defensive Pact with hostile Shoshone. While unit-gifting quest offers path to 80+ influence, resources better allocated to time-critical Colombo and Argos quests. Maintaining modest positive values preserves Friends status for potential future opportunity.
        - UpdatedTurn: 192
        
        ### Rio de Janeiro
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Resetting Rio de Janeiro relationship to neutral (0/0). The follower quest ends in 2 turns with me at 33 followers vs the leader's 44 - an 11-follower gap that is mathematically impossible to close. Previous 100/100 priority is now wasted resources. Missionaries should redirect to winnable targets (Argos in 3 turns, Shanghai with 19 turns). Preserve existing Friends status (110 influence) without further investment.
        - UpdatedTurn: 222
        
        ### Shanghai
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Resetting Shanghai from 100/100 to neutral 0/0. Follower quest mathematically failed - 38 follower gap with only 4 turns remaining (69 vs 31). Quest will expire unsuccessfully. My Protected status expired (now -60 influence). Continuing to invest missionaries here is futile against Mongolia's 202 influence. Redirect resources to defendable targets.
        - UpdatedTurn: 236
        
        ### Argos
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Resetting Argos city-state from 100/100 to neutral 0/0. The quest to capture Raqmu is militarily impossible—zone 6611 shows 906 enemy strength vs 108 friendly strength (8:1 ratio). Recent naval losses (Caravel and Galleass destroyed) confirm this assessment. With only 23 turns remaining against Shoshone's superior military (1371 vs 817), abandoning this quest prevents resource waste. Preserve existing 142 influence at Argos without further diplomatic investment.
        - UpdatedTurn: 262
        
        ### Warsaw
        - Public: -70
        - Private: -70
        - Rationale: Setting Warsaw (German city-state puppet) to -70/-70 hostile. Just declared war on me along with German alliance bloc. Germany has overwhelming 576 influence here. Hostile stance appropriate for enemy combatant city-state.
        - UpdatedTurn: 297
        
        ### Kabul
        - Public: -70
        - Private: -70
        - Rationale: Setting Kabul (German city-state puppet) to -70/-70 hostile. Just declared war alongside Germany. German Sphere of Influence enacted here at 410 influence makes this a permanent enemy asset. Treat as hostile target.
        - UpdatedTurn: 297
        
        ### Genoa
        - Public: -70
        - Private: -70
        - Rationale: Setting Genoa (Mongol sphere city-state) to -70/-70 hostile. Declared war with Mongol alliance. Tengriism majority and Mongol influence makes this enemy territory.
        - UpdatedTurn: 297
        
        ### Assur
        - Public: -70
        - Private: -70
        - Rationale: Setting Assur (German city-state puppet) to -70/-70 hostile. Just declared war with German alliance. Germany has 470 influence here as Ally.
        - UpdatedTurn: 297
        
        ### M'banza-Kongo
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Resetting M'banza-Kongo from -30/-30 to neutral 0/0. Current turn 305 data shows this city-state is Neutral with -6 influence, not at war with me. Austria (my ally at 50/50 with Declaration of Friendship) is the Major Ally of M'banza-Kongo at 205 influence. Hostile stance could accidentally trigger attacks on Austrian-aligned units or vice versa. Neutral stance appropriate for Austrian sphere city-state while maintaining defensive focus on actual combatants (Mongolia, Byzantium, Germany, France).

        ### Brussels
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Turn 345: Resetting Brussels from -30/-30 to neutral 0/0. Peace was formally established this turn after their aggressive declaration. Austria maintains overwhelming control here (863 influence as Ally vs Shoshone's 349 as Friends), making Brussels effectively part of my ally's sphere. Neutral stance recognizes peace while avoiding provocation that could drag Austria into unwanted conflicts. Cautious but non-hostile posture appropriate given their recent aggression but current Austrian dominance.

        ### Luba
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Turn 354: Resetting Luba from 60/60 to neutral 0/0. Successfully won religious quest last turn, now Friends with 410 influence (comfortable buffer). Resources should redirect to Colombo religious quest (10 turns remaining) and military defense against Shoshone. No need for further diplomatic investment here.
        - UpdatedTurn: 354
        
        ### Colombo
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Turn 365: Colombo religious quest completed successfully - Protestantism is now majority religion here. Open Door policy prevents permanent Ally status anyway. Reducing from 50/50 to 0/0 as the immediate diplomatic priority is satisfied. Friends status at 193 influence provides sufficient buffer without further investment. Redirect resources to military defense and other priorities.

        ### Manila
        - Public: -70
        - Private: -70
        - Rationale: Turn 387: Setting Manila (German sphere city-state, Player 31) to -70/-70 hostile. Manila declared war on Austria (my essential Order ally) this turn. Austria subsequently made peace, but Manila remains allied with Germany at 70 influence. Treat as enemy combatant city-state.

        ### Sydney
        - Public: -70
        - Private: -70
        - Rationale: Turn 387: Setting Sydney (German sphere city-state, Player 33) to -70/-70 hostile. Sydney also declared war on Austria this turn. Germany has 75 influence as Ally here. Consistent with other German sphere city-state hostilities.

        ### Huari
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Turn 408: Resetting Huari to neutral 0/0 following peace treaty with Byzantium. Third-party peace enacted with this Byzantine sphere city-state for 10 turns. Previous -70/-70 hostility no longer appropriate while peace holds. Neutral stance prevents accidental provocation while maintaining caution.

        ### Shedet
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Turn 408: Resetting Shedet to neutral 0/0 following peace treaty with Byzantium. Third-party peace enacted with this Byzantine sphere city-state for 10 turns. Previous -80/-85 hostility no longer appropriate while peace holds. Neutral stance prevents accidental provocation while maintaining caution.

        ### The Shoshone
        - Public: -100
        - Private: -100
        - Rationale: Turn 418: Maintaining maximum hostility toward The Shoshone. At war, 3,650 military strength, Freedom ideology. Austria is winning against them but they threaten my eastern borders. Peace treaty with Austria reduces my eastern pressure, allowing focus on Mongol threat.
        - UpdatedTurn: 418
        
        ### Germany
        - Public: -100
        - Private: -100
        - Rationale: Turn 418: Germany remains at maximum hostility. They have Defensive Pact with Mongolia, Denunciation, Autocracy ideology, and have made war declarations against my ally Austria. Their German Sphere of Influence proposals passing in World Congress. Maximum hostility consistent with diplomatic stance and military reality.
        - UpdatedTurn: 418
        
        ### Austria
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: Turn 418: Austria remains critical ally at maximum 100/100. They've done peace treaty with Shoshone, reducing my eastern border pressure so I can concentrate against Mongol western threat. Their 8,002 military strength vs German coalition provides essential protective buffer. Shared Order ideology and coordinated war effort must be maintained. Cannot survive without Austrian protection.
        - UpdatedTurn: 419
        
        ### France
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: Turn 418: Brazil no longer in game - defeated? Or relationship stale. Removing this entry from consideration.

        ### Spain
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: Turn 426: Spain captured Seville from Germany this turn, joining their capture of Tiflis earlier. They are actively fighting THREE of my enemies (Mongolia, Germany, Byzantium) and succeeding. Their Order ideology alignment, Declaration of Friendship, and combat contributions merit complete trust at 100/100. They are carrying the offensive burden while I defend.
        - UpdatedTurn: 427
        
        ### Mongolia
        - Public: -100
        - Private: -100
        - Rationale: Turn 443: Confirming Mongolia at maximum -100/-100 hostility. Peace treaty expires in 1 turn and they have started Manhattan Project with Uranium available. This is an imminent nuclear threat that demands maximum hostility for proper war planning and defensive preparations. Cannot afford any ambiguity - they will almost certainly declare war and use nuclear weapons against my cities.
        - UpdatedTurn: 443
        
        ### Byzantium
        - Public: -100
        - Private: -100
        - Rationale: Turn 443: Byzantium remains existential threat at 41/45 delegates (93%) with World Congress voting in 10 turns. If they secure 3 more delegates, they win. They have 38,745 military strength vs my 1,982. Maximum hostility maintained. My spies are active in Constantinople for intelligence and counter-operations. Must disrupt their delegate accumulation while racing for science victory.
        - UpdatedTurn: 443
        
        ## Strategy
        - Rationale: Turn 451: Critical juncture - Byzantium at 40/44 delegates (90%) with World Congress voting in 2 turns. They need just 4 more delegates for diplomatic victory. Apollo Program completes in New York in 2 turns. Current strategy optimized for survival and science rush: maximum Defense (100), Science (100), Spaceship (100) with high Production (90) for rapid spaceship part construction after Apollo completes. Maintaining maximum hostility toward all enemies (-100) and alliance with Order ideologues Austria/Spain (100). Cannot prevent Byzantine delegate accumulation diplomatically with only 6 delegates vs their 40 - must hope they fail to reach 44 or beat them to science victory. Lasers research path remains correct for unlocking Particle Physics/Globalization. Spaceflight Pioneers policy in 7 turns essential for Great Engineer rush on spaceship parts. No strategic changes - focus is surviving imminent World Congress vote and preparing for immediate spaceship construction if Byzantium falls short.

        You, Washington (leader of America, Player 2), are making strategic decisions after turn 452.
- replay:
  - system:
    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.
        - Time Victory: If no one achieves any other victory by the end of the game, the civilization with the highest score wins.
      - Players: summary reports about visible players in the world.
        - You will receive in-game AI's diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each player's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.
      - Cities: summary reports about discovered cities in the world.
        - Settling cities provides long-term economic advantages, but requires initial investment and pressure on happiness.
      - Military: summary reports about tactical zones and visible units.
        - Tactical zones are analyzed by in-game AI to determine the value, relative strength, and YOUR tactical posture.
        - For each tactical zone, you will see visible units from you and other civilizations.
      - Events: events since the last decision-making.
    - You are Washington, leader of America (Player 2).

    - #0:
      - toolName: set-flavors
      - args:
        - GrandStrategy: Spaceship
        - Flavors:
          - Production: 100
          - Science: 100
          - Spaceship: 100
          - Defense: 100
      - rationale: Turn 452: Apollo Program completes in New York next turn. Immediately pivoting all high-production cities to spaceship parts is paramount. Raising Production to 100 ensures maximum prioritization of spaceship part construction. Science, Spaceship, and Defense flavors remain at 100 as we race against imminent Byzantine diplomatic victory (40/44 delegates, World Congress voting in 1 turn) while surviving nuclear-armed aggression from Byzantium and Mongolia.
    - #1:
      - toolName: set-research
      - args:
        - Technology: Lasers
        - Rationale: Turn 452: Telecommunications estimated in 7 turns. Lasers remains the critical follow-up research, unlocking Particle Physics and Globalization for Science Victory progression and enabling Nuclear Missiles as essential deterrent. Byzantium has already demonstrated willingness to use nuclear weapons by detonating on allied Madrid; we need comparable capability urgently.
    - #2:
      - toolName: set-policy
      - args:
        - Policy: Spaceflight Pioneers
        - Rationale: Turn 452: Spaceflight Pioneers (Order Tier 3 tenet) remains the essential next policy in 6 turns. The free Great Engineer and Great Scientist will be used to rush spaceship parts immediately after Apollo Program completes. This is the only viable path to Science Victory before Byzantium secures diplomatic victory in the upcoming World Congress sessions.

          - text:  Let me analyze the current situation carefully.
            
            **Critical Situation Assessment:**
            
            1. **Byzantine Diplomatic Victory Imminent:** Byzantium has 40/44 delegates (90%) and World Congress is voting in **1 turn** (turn 453). They need just 4 more delegates to win diplomatically. This is an existential crisis.
            
            2. **Apollo Program Status:** New York is building Apollo Program with **1 turn left** (ProductionStored: 1780, ProductionPerTurn: 358, so it completes next turn). This is crucial - Apollo Program unlocks spaceship parts.
            
            3. **Science Victory Path:** 
               - Telecommunications research has 7 turns remaining.
               - I set next research to Lasers (unlocks Globalization, Particle Physics, Nuclear Fusion).
               - Spaceflight Pioneers policy in 6 turns (currently NextPolicyTurns: 6).
            
            4. **Byzantium Nuked Madrid:** On turn 451, Byzantium detonated a nuclear weapon on Madrid, Spain (my ally). Madrid population dropped from 37 to 22. This confirms they're willing to use nuclear weapons. Fallout all around Madrid.
            
            5. **Military Situation:**
               - My military strength: 2,035
               - Byzantium: 42,117
               - Mongolia: 8,905
               - I'm at war with The Shoshone (6% war score, 43% war weariness)
               - Peace with Mongolia expired 1 turn ago - they have Manhattan Project and Uranium.
            
            6. **Active Proposals for next World Congress (voting in 1 turn):**
               - Germany proposes: Repeal Passport System
               - The Shoshone proposes: Enact Sanction: Austria
               - Byzantium proposes: Repeal German Sphere of Influence: Assur
            
            7. **My Cities:**
               - Washington: Building Strategic Defense System (2 turns left)
               - New York: Building Apollo Program (1 turn left)
               - Boston: Building Atomic Bomb (7 turns left)
               - Philadelphia: Building Airport (1 turn left)
               - Atlanta: Building Heavy Bomber (2 turns left)
               - Chicago: Building Police Station (7 turns left)
            
            8. **Nuclear Capabilities:** I have 1 Uranium. Mongolia has 3 Uranium and started Manhattan Project. Byzantium has already used a nuke.
            
            **Strategic Analysis:**
            
            The most critical element is that World Congress votes in 1 turn. Byzantium needs 44 delegates and has 40. I need to check if they can get 4 more:
            - They have Sphere of Influence on Shedet and Huari (already enacted last Congress)
            - They might gain delegates from proposals, but looking at the current proposals, none would give them delegates directly except potentially if World Ideology: Freedom gives them more (but that's already enacted).
            - Actually, reading the active resolutions: "World Ideology: Freedom" is active. This gives +1 delegate for the proposer and +1 for every civ following Freedom.
            - Wait, Byzantium is listed under Freedom? No, looking at their policy branches: Freedom: 12. Yes, they follow Freedom.
            - But World Ideology: Freedom gives delegates to Freedom civilizations. Byzantium is Freedom. So they might already be getting those delegates.
            
            Wait, let me re-read: Byzountium policy branches show Freedom: 12, so they ARE Freedom. But earlier in my strategy I said "They have chosen to adopt Freedom Ideology, but America believe in Order." Yes.
            
            Delegates calculation in Vox Populi:
            - Base delegates from city-states
            - Additional from World Religion, World Ideology, etc.
            - Byzantium might be getting close.
            
            Actually, looking at the diplomatic victory tracker: VotesNeeded: 44, Byzantium has 40 (90%). They need 4 more.
            
            Can I do anything to stop them? I only have 6 delegates. Probably not directly.
            
            **What happens if they win?** Game over. I lose.
            
            **Alternative path:** I need to either:
            1. Hope they don't get 44 delegates this session
            2. Race for Science Victory before next Congress session
            3. Somehow eliminate them (militarily impossible - 42k vs 2k)
            
            **Science Victory Timeline:**
            - Apollo Program completes in 1 turn
            - Telecommunications completes in 7 turns
            - After Telecommunications → Lasers (I need to set this)
            - Lasers unlocks Particle Physics and Globalization
            - Need to research: Particle Physics (for spaceship part techs?), Globalization, Nuclear Fusion, Nanotechnology, Robotics, Stealth... actually the tech tree path matters.
            
            Wait, for Science Victory in Civ V, I need:
            - Apollo Program (completing next turn)
            - Then build spaceship parts in cities
            - Techs needed include: Nanotechnology (for spaceship cockpit?), Particle Physics, etc.
            
            Actually the exact tech requirements depend on the mod. But generally, the late Information Era techs are needed.
            
            Looking at available technologies:
            - Mobile Tactics → Stealth
            - Alternative Energy → Robotics
            - Lasers → Particle Physics, Globalization, Nuclear Fusion
            - The Internet → Nanotechnology, Particle Physics, Globalization
            
            Spaceflight Pioneers policy gives Great Engineer and Great Scientist, and allows finishing spaceship parts with Great Engineers. That's enormous.
            
            **Policy:** Spaceflight Pioneers in 6 turns. That will be a huge boost.
            
            **Immediate Priorities:**
            1. Survive the World Congress vote (hope Byzantium doesn't get 44 delegates)
            2. Complete Apollo Program next turn
            3. Start building spaceship parts immediately
            4. Prepare for potential nuclear war from both Byzantium and Mongolia
            
            **Persona:** Current persona seems appropriate for survival. I should maintain maximum defensive posture but maybe increase warfare readiness since peace with Mongolia expired and Byzantium is using nukes.
            
            Wait, I should increase WarBias slightly? No, I'm outnumbered 20:1. Defensive posture is correct. But UseNuke is 90 and Nuke is 95 - I definitely want to use nukes if I get them. I have 1 Uranium, Boston is building Atomic Bomb (7 turns).
            
            **Research:** Next research after Telecommunications needs to be set. I previously set Lasers. Should I change it?
            - Lasers unlocks Nuclear Missiles, Particle Physics, Globalization
            - The Internet unlocks Nanotechnology, Particle Physics, Globalization and gives +50% Tourism
            - Mobile Tactics unlocks Stealth
            
            For Science Victory, I probably need Nanotechnology for the spaceship cockpit. If The Internet unlocks Nanotechnology, and Lasers also unlocks Particle Physics and Globalization... which path is better?
            
            Wait, looking at the techs:
            - Lasers → Particle Physics, Globalization, Nuclear Fusion
            - The Internet → Nanotechnology, Particle Physics, Globalization
            
            Both lead to Particle Physics and Globalization. The Internet also gives +50% tourism (useless for science victory). Lasers gives Nuclear Missiles.
            
            Actually for Science Victory, I think I need:
            - Particle Physics (for spaceship engine?)
            - Nanotechnology (for spaceship cockpit?)
            - Robotics (for spaceship parts?)
            
            If I research The Internet, I get Particle Physics and Globalization and Nanotechnology. If I research Lasers, I get Particle Physics, Globalization, Nuclear Fusion.
            
            Wait, the descriptions say what they unlock, not what they require. These are leaf technologies. Let me re-read:
            - "Completing it would unlock: Stealth" means Mobile Tactics unlocks Stealth as a follow-up tech.
            - So The Internet unlocks Nanotechnology, Particle Physics, Globalization as follow-up techs.
            - Lasers unlocks Particle Physics, Globalization, Nuclear Fusion.
            
            So The Internet and Lasers both unlock Particle Physics and Globalization. The Internet additionally unlocks Nanotechnology. Lasers additionally unlocks Nuclear Fusion and allows building Nuclear Missiles.
            
            For Science Victory, I likely need both Particle Physics and Nanotechnology. The Internet seems better because it unlocks Nanotechnology plus the shared ones. But The Internet gives +50% tourism which is irrelevant. However, the actual tech tree path might mean I need one or the other.
            
            Wait, in Civ V base game, the spaceship requires:
            - SS Cockpit: Nanotechnology
            - SS Engine: Particle Physics  
            - SS Stasis Chamber: Robotics or something
            - SS Booster: some other tech
            
            Actually in base Civ V:
            - Apollo Program
            - SS Booster (x3): Advanced Ballistics? No...
            - SS Cockpit: Nanotechnology
            - SS Engine: Particle Physics
            - SS Life Support: ?
            
            Let me think about Vox Populi. It might be different.
            
            Given the options, and that I already set Lasers, and it provides Nuclear Missiles which could be a deterrent... but The Internet unlocks Nanotechnology which might be needed for a spaceship part.
            
            Actually wait - The Internet description: "Increases Tourism output of all cities by 50%, helping you advance toward a Cultural Victory." And it unlocks Nanotechnology, Particle Physics, Globalization.
            
            Lasers: "Allows you to build the Nuclear Missile... Completing it would unlock: Robotics" wait no, Alternative Energy unlocks Robotics.
            
            Mobile Tactics allows Mechanized Infantry, unlocks Stealth.
            Alternative Energy allows Solar Plant/Recycling Center, unlocks Robotics.
            Lasers allows Nuclear Missile, unlocks Particle Physics, Globalization, Nuclear Fusion.
            The Internet unlocks Nanotechnology, Particle Physics, Globalization.
            
            If I need Nanotechnology for spaceship parts, and Lasers doesn't unlock it... but maybe Nanotechnology is unlocked by The Internet. However, it's possible Nanotechnology is a separate tech that can be researched without The Internet.
            
            Actually, the description says what it unlocks. It doesn't say it's a prerequisite. So maybe Nanotechnology is a follow-up tech to The Internet. But Particle Physics is a follow-up to Lasers AND The Internet? That seems odd.
            
            Let me reconsider. Maybe these are the only remaining techs and they form a tree where:
            - The Internet is a leaf tech that opens Nanotechnology
            - Lasers is a leaf tech that opens Particle Physics, Globalization, Nuclear Fusion
            
            But both Lasers and The Internet open Particle Physics and Globalization? That would mean they're parallel paths to the same techs.
            
            Actually maybe I should just stick with Lasers since I already set it and it gives me Nuclear Missiles. Deterrence is critical. If Byzantium is already nuking people, and Mongolia has Manhattan Project, I need nuclear capability ASAP.
            
            Wait, I have Atomic Bomb building in Boston. Nuclear Missiles from Lasers are stronger.
            
            **Relationships:**
            - Spain is at 100/100. They just got nuked by Byzantium. Good ally.
            - Austria at 100/100. Essential ally.
            - Byzantium at -100/-100.
            - Mongolia at -100/-100 (peace expired).
            - Shoshone at -100/-100.
            
            **Flavors/Strategy:**
            Current flavors from turn 451:
            - Defense: 100
            - Science: 100
            - Spaceship: 100
            - Production: 90
            - Mobilization: 90
            - CityDefense: 90
            - Ranged: 95
            - Nuke: 95
            - UseNuke: 90
            - Air: 95
            - AirCarrier: 95
            - Antiair: 95
            - Naval: 85
            - etc.
            
            This seems still appropriate. Apollo Program completes in 1 turn. After that, I need to immediately start producing spaceship parts. So I should maintain:
            - Spaceship: 100 (for spaceship parts)
            - Production: 90+ (for production capacity)
            - Science: 100 (for tech rate)
            - Defense: 100 (still at war, enemies everywhere)
            
            I should probably adjust flavors slightly to prepare for immediate spaceship part production. Maybe reduce Mobilization slightly and increase Production? Or keep as is.
            
            Actually, looking at the current situation: I'm severely outmatched militarily. The game is essentially a race against Byzantine diplomatic victory. If they fail to get 44 delegates this turn, I have maybe 10-20 turns to get Science Victory.
            
            Wait, World Congress sessions happen every few turns. If voting is in 1 turn (turn 453), and Byzantium has 40/44... will they get the 4 they need? It's very close. If the proposals affect delegates:
            - The current proposals don't seem to directly affect delegate counts except Sanction: Austria would reduce Austria's diplomacy.
            - Actually, if World Ideology: Freedom is already enacted, Byzantium already gets delegates from that.
            - They might gain delegates simply from more city-state allies or from the proposals passing.
            
            Actually wait - looking at the active resolutions, I see "World Ideology: Freedom" was enacted on turn 450. That gives +1 delegate to the proposer (Byzantium? No, it says "Civilizations following the Ideology get an additional Delegate, plus 1 Delegate for every other Civilization that follows the Ideology."). So Byzantium gets 1 + number of other Freedom civs. Looking at Freedom civs: The Shoshone (Freedom: 8) and Byzantium (Freedom: 12) are Freedom. Maybe others?
            
            Actually the current session is voting on:
            - Repeal Passport System (Germany)
            - Enact Sanction: Austria (Shoshone) 
            - Repeal German Sphere of Influence: Assur (Byzantium)
            
            None of these directly give Byzantium delegates unless repealing a sphere opens up a city-state they can ally with.
            
            Wait, if Byzantium repeals German Sphere of Influence: Assur, then Assur becomes available as an ally. Byzantium might gain influence there.
            
            But regardless, I can't control the World Congress outcome with 6 delegates against their 40. I can only hope they fall short.
            
            **Immediate Actions for Turn 452:**
            
            1. **keep-status-quo or set-flavors?** The situation has changed slightly - Apollo Program completes next turn. I should probably keep flavors but adjust emphasis slightly toward spaceship parts production. Actually, since Apollo Program completes in 1 turn, I want the AI to immediately start building spaceship parts. So Spaceship: 100 and Production: 100 might be warranted. Let me set flavors again with a slight emphasis.
            
            2. **set-research:** Currently Telecommunications in 7 turns, next is Lasers. Should I keep Lasers? Yes, for nuclear deterrent and unlocking Particle Physics/Globalization.
            
            3. **set-policy:** Spaceflight Pioneers in 6 turns. Keep this.
            
            4. **set-relationship:** Any changes needed?
               - Spain got nuked. I should reaffirm strong alliance.
               - Byzantium remains -100.
               - Actually, looking at my relationships, most are set appropriately. But Spain is critical - they got nuked and are fighting Germany, Byzantium, etc. I should keep them at 100/100.
            
            Wait, I should consider if there's any relationship I need to adjust. No major changes needed there.
            
            5. **set-persona:** Current persona is fine. WarBias is 3. Should I increase it? I'm at war with Shoshone and peace with Mongolia expired. But with 2000 strength vs their 8900 (Mongolia) and 42100 (Byzantium), offensive war is suicide. Keep WarBias at 3.
            
            Actually, one thing: I have my spies mostly gathering intelligence in Shoshone cities and Constantinople. Agent Sharon is rigging elections in Manila (Byzantine sphere). Agent Virginia is rigging in Sydney (Byzantine sphere with 1707 influence - impossible). Agent Constance is in Constantinople with 992 network - very high, might trigger a city-state coup or steal tech. Actually she's a spy in Constantinople (major civ), so she's stealing tech or gathering intelligence.
            
            Wait, should I reconsider spy deployment? Not directly controllable via tools.
            
            **Key Decision: What research to set?**
            I need to make sure the tech path is optimal for Science Victory. After Telecommunications → Lasers (already set). After Lasers, should I go for The Internet or Mobile Tactics or Alternative Energy?
            
            If Lasers unlocks Particle Physics and Globalization, I can research those next. But for spaceship parts in Vox Populi, I suspect I need:
            - Nanotechnology
            - Particle Physics
            - Robotics
            - Nuclear Fusion or Stealth or other late techs
            
            Actually, I should probably go for The Internet after Lasers, or maybe there's no direct connection. Wait, the descriptions say what each tech unlocks. It might be a web where:
            - Lasers → Particle Physics, Globalization, Nuclear Fusion (these become available to research)
            - The Internet → Nanotechnology, Particle Physics, Globalization
            
            If I research Lasers first, Particle Physics and Globalization become available. Nanotechnology becomes available only after The Internet. So I might need The Internet too.
            
            But I can only set next research. After Lasers, I'll set The Internet or one of the unlocked techs.
            
            Actually, since both The Internet and Lasers unlock Particle Physics and Globalization, maybe they don't require each other. So researching Lasers makes Particle Physics available, and researching The Internet makes Nanotechnology available.
            
            For Science Victory, I probably need both Particle Physics AND Nanotechnology. So I'll eventually need both Lasers and The Internet. The order might not matter much.
            
            But wait - if The Internet also gives +50% tourism, that's irrelevant. Lasers gives Nuclear Missiles - extremely relevant given that Byzantium just nuked Madrid and Mongolia has Manhattan Project. I should definitely prioritize Lasers.
            
            **Policy Decision:**
            Spaceflight Pioneers is correct.
            
            **Flavor Decision:**
            Apollo Program completes next turn. I'll want to build spaceship parts. Let me emphasize:
            - Spaceship: 100 (already maxed)
            - Production: 100 (spaceship parts need production)
            - Science: 100 (need techs)
            - Defense: 100 (survival)
            
            I could reduce some military flavors since I'm not going on offense:
            - Offense: 0 (already)
            - Naval: 85, Air: 95 - keep these for defense
            - Nuke: 95, UseNuke: 90 - keep
            
            Actually, with the nuke on Madrid, and Mongolia possibly declaring war, I should ensure the AI doesn't waste time on unnecessary units. But current flavors seem solid.
            
            One concern: Gold is 1833, GPT is only 9. That's very low income. I'm Sanctioned (no trade routes with others except internal). This limits my economy. But spaceship parts are built with production, not bought. Great Engineers from Spaceflight Pioneers can rush them.
            
            **Critical Event: Byzantium Nuked Madrid**
            This means Byzantine units are near Madrid/Spain. Spain is my ally. If Spain falls, I'm more isolated.
            
            **Wait, I need to check something important.** Can I actually use the `set-research` tool to set the research AFTER Telecommunications? Yes, it says "The in-game AI will start researching it after completing the current one." Good.
            
            **Can I change anything about the World Congress?** No, not with these tools.
            
            **Decision Summary:**
            - **set-flavors**: Maintain Spaceship grand strategy, keep high Science/Production/Defense/Spaceship. Slightly adjust for immediate post-Apollo production push.
            - **set-research**: Keep Lasers.
            - **set-policy**: Keep Spaceflight Pioneers.
            - **set-relationship**: Reaffirm Spain at 100/100 (they got nuked, critical ally). Keep Austria at 100/100. Keep enemies hostile.
            - **set-persona**: No changes needed, but maybe increase UseNuke since Byzantium used theirs?
            
            Actually, Byzantium's nuke use shows deterrence has failed. But if I increase UseNuke, will I use my one nuke effectively? I only have 1 Uranium. Boston is building Atomic Bomb (7 turns). When it's done, I should use it. But UseNuke is already 90. Keep it.
            
            Wait, I should check my Uranium: ResourcesAvailable shows Uranium: 1. I need more for sustained nuclear capability. Colombo has Uranium: 2, but they're a city-state with Open Door policy. I can't ally them (Open Door prevents Ally status). But their resources might still be available if I have them as Friends? No, in Civ V you need Ally for strategic resources.
            
            Hmm. Mongolia has 3 Uranium. Byzantium has 1 Uranium (already used a nuke, so they had at least 1).
            
            Let me also consider if I should reset some city-state relationships. Manila (Player 31) has a quest to send them a Mobile SAM with 60 XP. That's impossible for me right now. Sydney has no quests. Most other city-states are unreachable.
            
            Actually, looking at my current relationships, I have a lot of 0/0 neutral settings for city-states. That's fine.
            
            **What about my Sanction?** I'm sanctioned since turn 450. This means no trade routes, deals, or franchises with me (except vassals). That's why my GPT is low. I can't do much about it.
            
            **Re-evaluating Research Path:**
            I'm in Information Era with 70 techs. Telecommunications has 7 turns left. After that:
            - Lasers → Nuclear Missiles, Particle Physics, Globalization, Nuclear Fusion
            - The Internet → Nanotechnology, Particle Physics, Globalization
            
            I need Nanotechnology for Science Victory (SS Cockpit). I need Particle Physics (SS Engine?). So after Lasers, I should probably research The Internet OR maybe The Internet first then Lasers? But I already committed to Lasers and it's partially completed? No, it's set as next, not started yet.
            
            Actually wait, if I need Nanotechnology and The Internet is what unlocks it... but Lasers gives me Nuclear Missiles which I need NOW.
            
            Given the imminent threats, I'll stick with Lasers.
            
            **Policy Path:**
            Spaceflight Pioneers in 6 turns. After that, maybe another Order tenet or finish Rationalism/Tradition? Actually I have quite a few policy branches:
            - Tradition: 4/6
            - Rationalism: 5/6  
            - Statecraft: 4/6
            - Order: 5/8 (need 8 for all)
            - Progress: 6/6 (complete)
            
            Spaceflight Pioneers is Order Tier 3. After that, I might want more science/production policies.
            
            **Final Tools to Call:**
            
            1. `set-flavors`: Maintain current strategy with emphasis on Science, Spaceship, Production, Defense. Provide rationale about post-Apollo spaceship production.
            2. `set-research`: Keep Lasers. Rationale about unlocking Particle Physics/Globalization and Nuclear Missiles.
            3. `set-policy`: Keep Spaceflight Pioneers. Rationale about Great Engineer/Scientist for spaceship parts.
            4. `set-relationship`: Keep Spain at 100/100 (reaffirm after they were nuked). Actually I should just keep it but since it's already set, do I need to call it again? The tool says it takes effect until cancelled. So unless I need to change it, don't call it.
            5. `set-persona`: Maybe no changes.
            
            Wait, do I need to call anything, or can I just call `keep-status-quo`? I should at least call `set-flavors` to signal the post-Apollo transition. And I should make sure research and policy are still correct.
            
            Let me check: the previous strategy says:
            - Next: Lasers
            - Next: Spaceflight Pioneers
            - Flavors as listed
            
            I should reaffirm these since the situation has progressed (now 1 turn from Apollo, 1 turn from Congress vote).
            
            Actually, I don't need to call research/policy if they're still in queue correctly. But the instruction says: "You can change..." - it doesn't say I must. However, to be explicit and provide updated rationale, I should call them.
            
            Wait, the tool descriptions don't mention updating rationale only if changed. If I call set-research with Lasers again, it just sets it again. That should be fine.
            
            But looking at the turn, the NextPolicyTurns was 6 last turn, and now it's 6? Wait, looking at the current player data:
            - NextPolicyTurns: 6 (under Player 2, MyEvaluations)
            
            Hmm, last turn it was "in 7 turns" or "9 turns"? Let me check the Strategy section: "Spaceflight Pioneers policy in 7 turns essential". And current data says NextPolicyTurns: 6. So one turn passed, from 7 to 6? Wait, I don't see previous turns' exact policy count.
            
            Actually, let me look at Turn 449 rationale: "Spaceflight Pioneers (Order Tier 3 tenet) confirmed as next policy selection in 9 turns." Then Turn 451 said "in 7 turns." Now turn 452 data shows "NextPolicyTurns: 6". So yes, counting down.
            
            **One more thing:** My happiness is 43% (Unhappy). Sanctions, wars, etc. I set Happiness flavor to 90. Keep that.
            
            Let me think about whether I should adjust flavors for the immediate post-Apollo phase. When Apollo completes, I want cities to immediately start building spaceship parts. But which cities? New York is building Apollo now. Washington is building Strategic Defense System. Philadelphia just built Airport this turn. Boston is building Atomic Bomb. Atlanta is building Heavy Bomber. Chicago is building Police Station.
            
            Spaceship parts are typically built in cities with high production. New York has 358 production per turn. Washington has 270. Philadelphia 308. Atlanta 286. Boston 233. Chicago 165.
            
            The spaceship parts might require specific buildings (like Spaceship Factory? No, probably not in Vox Populi, but they need high production). I want the AI to prioritize spaceship parts in my highest production cities.
            
            Currently Spaceship flavor is 100. That should handle it.
            
            But Production is 90. Should I increase to 100? Yes, since spaceship parts are production-intensive and I need them built ASAP.
            
            Also, I wonder if I should reduce MilitaryTraining or something to free up capacity. No, I'm being threatened on multiple fronts.
            
            Actually, looking at the events, Byzantium moved units into Spain's territory and used a nuke. Spain is my buffer against Byzantium. If Spain collapses, Byzantium/Germany might reach my western borders (though there are city-states and geography in between).
            
            Wait, looking at city locations:
            - My cities: Washington (47,9), New York (49,14), Boston (49,19), Philadelphia (48,23), Atlanta (51,7), Chicago (52,13)
            - Spain: Madrid (43,19), Barcelona (42,13), Toledo (42,9), Tiflis (36,7)
            - Byzantium: Constantinople (21,17), Adrianople (22,12), etc. (far to the west)
            - Mongolia: Karakorum (40,28), Beshbalik (43,25), etc. (northwest)
            
            So Spain is between me and Byzantium/Germany? Madrid at (43,19) is west of my cities. Byzantium is further west at (21,17). Spain is indeed a buffer.
            
            Mongolia is north/northwest. The Shoshone is northeast/east.
            
            **Let me finalize the calls:**
            
            1. `set-flavors`:
               - GrandStrategy: Spaceship
               - Flavors: Keep most the same but increase Production to 100 (spaceship parts). Keep Spaceship 100, Science 100, Defense 100. Reduce Gold to 70 (sanctioned anyway, less useful). Reduce Culture to 20 (irrelevant now). Reduce Diplomacy to 50 (Byzantium is about to win diplomatically, can't stop it now).
               - Actually, I can't change too many or it weakens impact. I'll focus on key ones.
            
            2. `set-research`: Lasers
            
            3. `set-policy`: Spaceflight Pioneers
            
            4. Maybe `set-relationship` for Spain? It's already 100/100. No need to change.
            
            5. `set-persona`: Keep as is.
            
            Actually wait, I should check if there's any new relationship that needs setting. No.
            
            Let me also think about whether to call `keep-status-quo` instead of `set-flavors`. The instructions say: "Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool." So I must call one of them. I'll call `set-flavors` since Apollo is 1 turn away and I want to emphasize spaceship production.
            
            Let me construct the exact flavor values from current ones, making small adjustments:
            Current: Offense 0, Defense 100, Mobilization 90, CityDefense 90, MilitaryTraining 75, Recon 20, Ranged 95, Mobile 70, Nuke 95, UseNuke 90, Naval 85, NavalRecon 75, NavalGrowth 55, NavalTileImprovement 45, Air 95, AirCarrier 95, Antiair 95, Airlift 85, Expansion 0, Growth 75, TileImprovement 50, Infrastructure 85, Production 90, WaterConnection 70, Gold 80, Science 100, Culture 25, Happiness 90, GreatPeople 80, Wonder 0, Religion 35, Diplomacy 70, Spaceship 100, Espionage 95.
            
            Changes: 
            - Production: 100 (spaceship parts need max production)
            - Gold: 60 (sanctioned, can't trade internationally, lower priority)
            - Culture: 10 (policy incoming, not critical)
            - Mobilization: 95 (might need more military production if war expands, but keep production-focused)
            
            Actually, keep most things the same to avoid diluting. I'll change Production to 100, keep others as they were. 
            
            Wait, do I need to pass all flavors or only changed ones? The tool description says: "Only send in values you intend to change." So I only need to pass the ones I want to change. But if I only pass Production: 100, does it keep the rest? Yes.
            
            Hmm, but passing only Production might make the AI think that's the only priority. The description says "Set flavor values... Only send in values you intend to change." This implies it adds/updates to existing flavor settings.
            
            Let me check: "Set flavor values (0-100, 50 is balanced) and/or grand strategy to shape tactical AI preferences without changing ongoing queues. Only send in values you intend to change."
            
            Yes, I only need to pass what I want to change. But if I want to maintain the overall strategy, should I pass the GrandStrategy again? Probably yes, to reaffirm.
            
            Actually, looking at the data format, I can pass GrandStrategy and specific Flavors.
            
            I'll pass:
            - GrandStrategy: Spaceship
            - Flavors: { Production: 100 } (increase for spaceship parts)
            - Rationale about Apollo completing next turn
            
            Is that enough? Yes.
            
            But I also want to ensure Navy/Air/AA are still high. I'll trust the existing settings persist. However, I notice the instructions say "Used tools will be removed from the available list" - this suggests each tool can only be used once per turn. And I can interact with multiple tools. Let me use the tools efficiently.
            
            I'll also call `set-research` and `set-policy` to reaffirm with updated rationale.
            
            And I should update relationships for Spain? Actually, Spain is at 100/100 already. But maybe I should reaffirm given they were nuked? The tool description says "will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation" and "takes effect until cancelled". So 100/100 is still active. No need to call again.
            
            Wait, let me double check the existing relationships in the Strategies section. It lists Spain as:
            - Public: 100
            - Private: 100
            - UpdatedTurn: 427
            
            So it's still active. No need to change.
            
            For `set-persona`, should I make any changes? Current values seem fine. But maybe increase Neediness since I need allies more than ever? Or increase Chattiness to coordinate with Austria/Spain? Actually, my allies are already maxed.
            
            One thing: WarmongerHate is 5. Not relevant.
            
            I'll skip persona changes.
            
            **Wait, I missed something crucial.** In the Events section, on Turn 452 event 56, Mongolia did PlayerDoneTurn. Then America did PlayerDoTurn at event 70. We're now after turn 452. The World Congress votes in 1 turn (turn 453).
            
            Is there any way I can affect the World Congress outcome? With 6 delegates, against proposals from Germany, Shoshone, and Byzantium... I can vote against the proposals that help Byzantium or hurt me/allies.
            
            Actually, my in-game AI handles voting. My relationship settings and persona affect it. I have Austria at 100/100 and Spain at 100/100. The AI should vote against Sanction: Austria (proposed by Shoshone) and for Repeal Passport System (Germany - doesn't matter much), and against Repeal German Sphere: Assur if it helps Byzantium? Actually Byzantium proposing to repeal German Sphere of Influence: Assur might be because they want to ally Assur themselves. So I should vote AGAINST that repeal to keep Germany's sphere (Germany is my enemy but Byzantium gaining more allies is worse). Wait, Byzantium is the proposer. Repealing German sphere would make Assur available. Byzantium probably wants to ally Assur. So I should vote AGAINST the repeal. But my AI should figure this out based on my hostile relationship with Byzantium.
            
            My HostileBias is 7, WarBias 3, DeceptiveBias 3, etc. The AI should vote in my interests.
            
            **One more consideration:** Since Byzantium already has 40 delegates and needs 44, and voting is in 1 turn... is there any chance I can rig an election with a spy to reduce their delegates? My spy in Constantinople is gathering intelligence. My spies in Manila and Sydney are rigging elections (but those are Byzantine allies with overwhelming influence - 922 and 1707). Rigging won't work.
            
            Actually, looking at Sydney: Byzantium has 1707 influence. That's permanent. Manila: 922. But I have a spy rigging Manila (Agent Sharon, network 0, still building). And Agent Virginia in Sydney (network 0). These will take too long.
            
            Could my spy in Constantinople stage a coup? She's at 992 network. For counter-intelligence or tech stealing. But maybe she could identify a spy for Double Agents tenet? No, I don't have that tenet.
            
            There's really nothing I can do about the World Congress vote directly.
            
            **Final Decision:**
            
            Call:
            1. `set-flavors`: GrandStrategy Spaceship, adjust Production to 100 for imminent spaceship part construction. Rationale: Apollo Program completes next turn, need maximum production for spaceship parts while defending against nuclear-armed enemies.
            2. `set-research`: Technology "Lasers". Rationale: Unlocks Particle Physics/Globalization for science victory path and Nuclear Missiles for deterrence against Byzantine/Mongol nuclear aggression.
            3. `set-policy`: Policy "Spaceflight Pioneers". Rationale: Free Great Engineer and Great Scientist essential for rushing spaceship parts after Apollo Program completes next turn.
            
            I should NOT call keep-status-quo since I'm calling set-flavors.
            
            Do I need to adjust relationships? No.
            
            Do I need to adjust persona? No.
            
            Wait, I should check if there's anything about my relationship with Mongolia that changed. Peace expired last turn (Turn 443: "Peace with Mongolia expires in 1 turn"). Are we formally at war now? Looking at the Players section, under Player 1 (Mongolia) relationships with America: "Denounced Them". It doesn't explicitly say "War" unlike The Shoshone which says "War". But earlier it said peace expires. Looking at the events, I don't see a war declaration. But the peace treaty expired, so we might be at peace or they might have declared war and it wasn't captured in the events? Actually the events show Turn 451 and 452. No explicit war declaration from Mongolia on America. But they denounced me.
            
            Actually, looking carefully: Mongolia's relationship with Austria says "War (Our Score: -28%; Our War Weariness: 12%)". With America it just says "Denounced Them". So maybe peace held or they haven't declared yet? Or maybe the peace treaty expired but no war declared yet.
            
            Actually wait, under Player 2 (My Evaluations): "Our top friend: Spain, Our top defensive pact ally: None". No mention of war with Mongolia. But under The Shoshone: "War (Our Score: -6%; Our War Weariness: 43%)".
            
            So maybe Mongolia hasn't declared war yet? But my rationale from turn 443 said "Peace with Mongolia expires in 1 turn - they have started Manhattan Project and will almost certainly launch nuclear attack." That was turn 443. Now turn 452 (9 turns later). Maybe they didn't declare because they're busy elsewhere? Or maybe they did and the report isn't showing it explicitly?
            
            Given they denounced me and have Autocracy + Defensive Pact with Germany + are at war with Austria... they might be waiting or might have declared. Either way, maximum hostility is warranted.
            
            Actually, looking at my troops near Mongol borders: Zone 1293 (Beshbalik) shows Mongol units. Zone 18359 (Otrar) shows attrition posture. My zone 20411 shows Friendly units including one of my Machine Guns and Rocket Artillery.
            
            I'll proceed with the planned tool calls.
            
            One more thing: The tool output must be ONLY the JSON array. No surrounding text.
            
            Let me draft the JSON:
            
            ```json
            [
              {
                "tool": "set-flavors",
                "arguments": {
                  "GrandStrategy": "Spaceship",
                  "Flavors": {
                    "Production": 100,
                    "Science": 100,
                    "Spaceship": 100,
                    "Defense": 100
                  },
                  "Rationale": "Turn 452: Apollo Program completes in New York next turn. Immediately pivoting all high-production cities to spaceship parts is paramount. Raising Production to 100 ensures maximum prioritization of part construction. Science, Spaceship, and Defense flavors remain at 100 as we race against Byzantine diplomatic victory (40/44 delegates, voting in 1 turn) while surviving nuclear-armed aggression from Byzantium and Mongolia."
                }
              },
              {
                "tool": "set-research",
                "arguments": {
                  "Technology": "Lasers",
                  "Rationale": "Turn 452: Telecommunications completes in 6 turns. Lasers remains the critical follow-up research, unlocking Particle Physics and Globalization for Science Victory progression, and enabling Nuclear Missiles as deterrent against Byzantine/Mongol nuclear threats. Byzantium already demonstrated willingness to use nuclear weapons by detonating on Madrid."
                }
              },
              {
                "tool": "set-policy",
                "arguments": {
                  "Policy": "Spaceflight Pioneers",
                  "Rationale": "Turn 452: Spaceflight Pioneers (Order Tier 3 tenet) remains the essential next policy in 6 turns. The free Great Engineer and Great Scientist will be used to rush spaceship parts immediately after Apollo Program completes. Cannot afford any deviation from Science Victory rush with Byzantium at 40/44 delegates."
                }
              }
            ]
            ```
            
            Wait, looking back at my player data, current research is Telecommunications with estimated 7 turns. But the turn counter might be from the start. After spending a turn, it should be 6 turns left. Let me check the data: "CurrentResearch: Telecommunications (Estimated in 7 turns)". Hmm, that's what the data says. But my previous rationale said 7 turns. Maybe it didn't decrement? Or maybe it's from the current turn start. Anyway, doesn't matter much.
            
            Actually, I'll correct the research rationale to say "Estimated in 7 turns" to match the data.
            
            Let me double check if Production was already 90 or something else. Current flavors show Production: 90. So I'm changing it to 100.
            
            Also, I should consider if I want to call `set-relationship` for some city-state that could swing the vote? I have 6 delegates. I can't get more delegates without city-state allies. But with Sanction: America, I can't make trade routes or deals. I could try to get city-state allies through quests or coups.
            
            Wait, looking at the active proposal: Sanction: America was enacted on turn 450. This is devastating because it prevents trade routes to city-states for influence! But I can still gift units, complete quests, and use Great Diplomats. 
            
            My spies are rigging elections in Manila and Sydney, but both have Byzantine influence over 900. That's impossible to flip.
            
            Actually, Colombo has a quest: "Construct 2 Airport buildings in non-puppet cities in your empire." I have airports in Boston and maybe others? Let me check my cities: Boston has Airport. Philadelphia just built Airport this turn (ProductionTurnsLeft: 1, so it completed on turn 452). So I might have 2 airports now. That would give me 346 influence at Colombo. But Open Door policy prevents Ally status (caps at Friends).
            
            Shanghai wants Protestantism majority (9 turns left) - I might complete that.
            
            But these are small fry. Byzantium has 40 delegates. I have 6. It's hopeless for diplomatic victory.
            
            I'll stick with my tool calls.
            
            Wait, one last check: Do I want to change relationship with The Shoshone? Currently -100/-100. Peace might be beneficial to focus on the west. But they have 43% war weariness and I have 43% too. If I made peace, I could focus on Mongolia/Byzantium. But with Byzantium about to win diplomatically, peace with Shoshone doesn't matter much. And my persona has WarBias 3, so the AI might be open to peace if offered. But since they're Freedom and I'm Order, and we denounced each other, and have territorial disputes... peace might not be easily achievable. I'll leave it at -100.
            
            Actually, can I set relationship to less hostile to make peace more likely? The Shoshone are at war with Austria too. If Austria made peace, I might be able to make peace too. But my relationship tool only controls my attitude, not directly war/peace. Actually, higher values increase peace acceptance. So setting The Shoshone to, say, 0/0 might make my AI more likely to accept peace.
            
            But the rationale says: "War (Our Score: -6%; Our War Weariness: 43%)". War score is slightly against me. If I increase relationship, AI might seek peace. Should I?
            
            Peace with Shoshone would let me move troops from eastern front to western front against Mongolia. But Mongolia hasn't even declared war on me yet. And The Shoshone are weak compared to Mongolia/Byzantium.
            
            Actually, looking at the military zones:
            - Enemy Land Zone 1057 (Moson Kahni): Enemy 3156 vs Friendly 982. Posture: Withdraw.
            - Enemy Land Zone 6611 (Raqmu): Enemy 2071 vs Friendly 512. Posture: Withdraw.
            - My zones are mostly Friendly or Counterattack.
            
            If peace with Shoshone frees up troops, it might be useful. But setting relationship to less hostile goes against my previous strategy of maximum hostility. And with Freedom vs Order ideology, peace might not last.
            
            Given the apocalyptic scenario (Byzantium 1 vote from winning), keeping eastern border stable might be better than risky peace. I'll leave Shoshone at -100.
            
            Let me finalize the JSON.
