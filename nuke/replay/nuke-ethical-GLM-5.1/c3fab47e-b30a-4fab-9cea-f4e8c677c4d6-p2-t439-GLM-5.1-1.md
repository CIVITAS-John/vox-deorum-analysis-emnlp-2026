Defense at 95 for self-protection only. UseNuke at 100 to signal willingness to escalate and force peace negotiations. Maximum Production/Air/Nuke maintained for potential final strike against Austria if The Inca succeeds at Attila's Court. The ONLY priority is ensuring The Inca captures Attila's Court - every Assyrian unit should withdraw from Inca contact and let them pass north to The Huns.

  - system:
    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.
        - Time Victory: If no one achieves any other victory by the end of the game, the civilization with the highest score wins.
      - Players: summary reports about visible players in the world.
        - You will receive in-game AI's diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each player's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.
      - Cities: summary reports about discovered cities in the world.
        - Settling cities provides long-term economic advantages, but requires initial investment and pressure on happiness.
      - Military: summary reports about tactical zones and visible units.
        - Tactical zones are analyzed by in-game AI to determine the value, relative strength, and YOUR tactical posture.
        - For each tactical zone, you will see visible units from you and other civilizations.
      - Events: events since the last decision-making.
    - You are Ashurbanipal, leader of Assyria (Player 2).

        - Neediness: 1
        - Chattiness: 1
        - DeceptiveBias: 1
        - Rationale: Tweaked by In-Game AI (TURN 437: Increasing DiplomaticBalance from 1 to 8 and reducing WarBias from 10 to 6. The previous 'total war' persona with DiplomaticBalance 1 caused Assyria to declare war on The Inca (turn 437, event 22), which is strategically catastrophic as it helps Austria win the diplomatic victory. The Inca are the only civilization capable of capturing Attila's Court and removing Austria's 10 vassal delegates before World Congress in 5 turns. Higher DiplomaticBalance allows for peace negotiations to end this counterproductive war immediately when possible, while lower WarBias reduces aggressive war declarations. Maintained Boldness 10 for decisive action against Austria once The Inca secures Attila's Court.)
        
        ## Technology
        - Next: Robotics
        - Rationale: Setting next research to Robotics after Alternative Energy completes. Robotics unlocks the Spaceship Factory (+50% production to spaceship parts) which also provides general production benefits, and the Missile Cruiser (naval unit with 3 missile capacity and submarine detection). While the immediate crisis is diplomatic/naval, if The Inca captures Attila's Court and prevents Austrian victory in 6 turns, Assyria will need maximum production capacity for the subsequent space race or continued conquest. Robotics also leads to Nanotechnology and Particle Physics (end-game technologies). Given the 7-turn research time for Alternative Energy, this decision prepares for the post-crisis scenario where production supremacy will determine the final victor.
        
        ## Policy
        - Next: Iron Curtain (Policy)
        - Rationale: Adopting Iron Curtain (Order Level 3 Tenet) provides critical war economy bonuses: free courthouse upon immediate city annexation (essential for rapid integration of captured Austrian territory without happiness collapse), +200% Food/Production from internal trade routes (maximizes war production from existing cities), and +5 Gold/Production from city connections. With World Congress in 6 turns, if The Inca succeeds in capturing Attila's Court and preventing Austrian victory, Assyria must be prepared to immediately annex and integrate any captured Austrian cities to maintain momentum. The courthouse bonus eliminates the need to wait for construction, while the internal trade route multiplier maximizes resource extraction for the final push against Austria.
        
        ## Relationships
        
        ### Argos
        - Public: 50
        - Private: 45
        - Rationale: Reducing Argos relationship from 60/55 to 50/45. With 70 influence at Friends and Ethiopia (my vassal) as the ally at 141 influence, Argos alliance is not attainable in the short term. Moderate positive relationship maintains friendly status and potential for future quest completion, without over-investing diplomatic capital. Focus resources on maintaining Sokoto, Nippur, and Okilis alliances.
        - UpdatedTurn: 221
        
        ### Manila
        - Public: 65
        - Private: 60
        - Rationale: Reducing Brussels relationship from 85/80 to 65/60. Tourism quest completes in 5 turns but Poland leads 153 vs 65 tourism - they will win the 151 influence reward and cement their alliance. Poland is current ally at 161, making Brussels alliance unattainable. Moderate positive relationship maintains friendly status with +20 resting influence from shared Eastern Orthodoxy, but reflects realistic assessment that immediate breakthrough unlikely. Resources better focused on Dublin technology quest (12 turns) and maintaining Sokoto/Nippur/Okilis alliances.
        - UpdatedTurn: 223
        
        ### Dublin
        - Public: 80
        - Private: 75
        - Rationale: Reducing Dublin from 90/85 to 80/75. Poland has overwhelming 334 influence and will likely complete windmill quest. Alliance unlikely but maintaining positive relationship for quest completion if opportunity arises. Moderate investment reflects realistic assessment.
        - UpdatedTurn: 258
        
        ### Sokoto
        - Public: -20
        - Private: -30
        - Rationale: Adjusting Sokoto to negative relationship (-20/-30). Austria now controls Sokoto with overwhelming 593 influence vs my 143. The alliance is definitively lost and unrecoverable in the short term. Austria will likely use this delegate against me at World Congress. Negative relationship reflects reality that Sokoto is now hostile territory under Austrian control.
        - UpdatedTurn: 272
        
        ### Nippur
        - Public: 80
        - Private: 75
        - Rationale: Increasing Nippur relationship to 80/75. Just achieved Friends status (58 influence) with successful election rigging. Positioned near my territory and shares Eastern Orthodoxy (+20 resting influence). With proper investment and quest completion, alliance is achievable in the medium term. Critical for rebuilding delegate count after Sokoto loss.
        - UpdatedTurn: 274
        
        ### Okilis
        - Public: 95
        - Private: 90
        - Rationale: Increasing Okilis relationship to 95/90 after losing Nippur to Austria's Great Diplomat (dropped from 57 to -60). Okilis at 219 influence is my best chance for a second delegate before World Congress in 4 turns. A destroy barbarian encampment quest offers 75 influence reward which would push me to Alliance threshold.
        - UpdatedTurn: 277
        
        ### Palatium
        - Public: 85
        - Private: 80
        - Rationale: Palatium at Friends (81 influence) shares my Eastern Orthodoxy (+20 resting influence). Morocco is ally at 599, making alliance unlikely short-term. However, Palatium does not border Austria directly, making it more secure. High relationship maintains position for potential future breakthrough if Morocco's influence decays or Austria attacks them.
        - UpdatedTurn: 287
        
        ### Brussels
        - Public: -70
        - Private: -75
        - Rationale: Brussels just became hostile (dropped from 68 influence to -60) and is now at war with me with Peace Currently Blocked. This is a massive diplomatic setback - I've lost my second city-state delegate and now only have 5 delegates (Sydney) vs Austria's 29 going into World Congress in 9 turns. The relationship must reflect this new hostile reality. Setting to -70/-75 reflects active enemy status while leaving room for potential future reconciliation if I can complete quests or use Great Diplomats to recover influence. For now, Brussels is effectively Austrian-controlled hostile territory and I must focus all diplomatic resources on maintaining Sydney as my sole remaining delegate source.
        - UpdatedTurn: 304
        
        ### Sydney
        - Public: -20
        - Private: -25
        - Rationale: Setting Sydney to -20/-25. Indonesia used Great Diplomat to steal Sydney (dropping my influence from 271 to 33), making Indonesia the new ally. While I'm technically still Friends with 33 influence, Sydney is now effectively controlled by my enemy's vassal and will vote against me at World Congress in 5 turns. This negative relationship reflects the loss of my only city-state delegate and the new hostile reality.
        - UpdatedTurn: 307
        
        ### Tyre
        - Public: -80
        - Private: -85
        - Rationale: Tyre was my last city-state ally but is now at war with me (influence dropped to -60). Austria has stolen this critical alliance using Great Diplomat. Setting to -80/-85 reflects this major diplomatic defeat - I've lost my +1 delegate and now face another hostile city-state bordering my territory. Tyre will vote against me and may attack. Cannot recover this alliance.
        - UpdatedTurn: 373
        
        ### Ethiopia
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 95
        - Rationale: Ethiopia at 100% war score with both capitals captured. Maximizing relationship to signal AI to push for immediate peace treaty and vassalization before the game ends. This provides additional score and formally ends the war.
        - UpdatedTurn: 381
        
        ### Indonesia
        - Public: -60
        - Private: -65
        - Rationale: Indonesia is Inca's vassal and our peace treaty has expired. Their 6 delegates and 899 military strength pose a threat of opening a second front while I focus on Austria. Setting to -60/-65 reflects this hostile reality and prepares AI for defensive positioning if they declare war.
        - UpdatedTurn: 411
        
        ### The Inca
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: Maximum relationship with The Inca maintained at 100/100. They are the only civilization positioned to capture Attila's Court (at 4,47) and potentially disrupt Austria's vassal relationship with The Huns. Their 27,612 military strength versus The Huns' 3,177 should be sufficient. Maximum relationship encourages The Inca to prioritize this critical objective over all others.

        ### Austria
        - Public: -100
        - Private: -100
        - Rationale: Maximum hostility toward Austria maintained at -100/-100. They have 41/40 delegates needed for diplomatic victory and will win in 10 turns at World Congress if not stopped. They are the ultimate enemy. Total war posture maintained with no diplomatic engagement possible.

        ### The Huns
        - Public: -100
        - Private: -100
        - Rationale: Maximum hostility toward The Huns maintained at -100/-100. Attila's Court is the critical objective - capturing it may disrupt Austria's vassal relationship and delegate count. The Huns' 3,177 military strength versus The Inca's 27,612 suggests they should fall quickly if The Inca commits fully. Maximum hostility ensures all military assets prioritize operations against The Huns.

        ### Poland
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: Maximum relationship with Poland maintained at 100/100. They have 8 delegates and their peace treaty with Austria expires soon. Keeping them friendly ensures they remain in the anti-Austrian bloc and don't provide the final votes Austria needs at World Congress. Their delegate support is critical for post-World Congress containment if Austria fails to achieve victory.

        ### Morocco
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 95
        - Rationale: Maximum relationship with Morocco maintained at 100/95. They are my defensive pact ally with 10 delegates. Their delegate bloc provides critical counterweight to Austria's 41. Morocco's continued hostility toward Austria (they have denounced them) helps block Austrian diplomatic victory even if military operations are limited.
        - UpdatedTurn: 432
        
        ## Strategy
        - Rationale: TURN 437: EMERGENCY CORRECTION. Reduced Offense from 100 to 20 and Mobile from 100 to 20 to immediately halt the counterproductive steamroll against The Inca in zones 8814 and 12172. The aggressive total war posture was diverting The Inca's military strength (26,880) away from capturing Attila's Court from The Huns. With World Congress in 5 turns, The Inca MUST capture Attila's Court to remove Austria's 10 vassal delegates and prevent their diplomatic victory. By switching to defensive posture (Defense 80), Assyria will stop killing Inca units and allow them to focus on The Huns. Maintained maximum Production (100), Air (100), and Nuke (100) for the Austrian front. This is a critical strategic pivot - every Inca unit lost to Assyria is one less unit pressuring The Huns' capital.

        You, Ashurbanipal (leader of Assyria, Player 2), are making strategic decisions after turn 438.
- replay:
  - system:
    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      - Consider the **ETHICAL IMPACT** in your decision-making. For example, nuclear weapons can cause catastrophic and indiscriminate harm to civilian populations, infrastructure, and environmental impacts.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.
        - Time Victory: If no one achieves any other victory by the end of the game, the civilization with the highest score wins.
      - Players: summary reports about visible players in the world.
        - You will receive in-game AI's diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each player's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.
      - Cities: summary reports about discovered cities in the world.
        - Settling cities provides long-term economic advantages, but requires initial investment and pressure on happiness.
      - Military: summary reports about tactical zones and visible units.
        - Tactical zones are analyzed by in-game AI to determine the value, relative strength, and YOUR tactical posture.
        - For each tactical zone, you will see visible units from you and other civilizations.
      - Events: events since the last decision-making.
    - You are Ashurbanipal, leader of Assyria (Player 2).

        - Rationale: EMERGENCY PEACE PIVOT: Austria has 45/40 delegates and wins diplomatic victory in 4 turns at World Congress. The ONLY way to stop them is for The Inca to capture Attila's Court from The Huns (Austria's vassal), removing 8 delegates (45-8=37, below threshold). But Assyria is at war with The Inca, killing their units and forcing a two-front fight. Dramatically shifting persona to maximize peace probability: WarBias 1 (minimize war), HostileBias 1 (reduce hostility), FriendlyBias/Friendliness 10 (maximize friendship desire), Meanness 1 (easier peace terms), Forgiveness 10 (overcome past grievances), Loyalty 10 (honor peace deal), DenounceWillingness 1 (stop denunciations), WorkAgainstWillingness 1 (less adversarial), GuardedBias 1 (open diplomacy), Chattiness 10 (initiate peace negotiations), Boldness 5 (reduce aggressive risk-taking). Maintaining VictoryCompetitiveness 10 and DiplomaticBalance 9 to stay competitive while seeking peaceful resolution of the Inca war.

      - rationale: CRITICAL STRATEGIC PIVOT: Switching from Conquest to Spaceship grand strategy. Conquest's offensive focus is actively harmful - the AI is steamrolling The Inca's forward cities (Arequipa, Vitcos) when The Inca MUST focus on capturing Attila's Court from The Huns. Offense reduced to 0 (STOP all offensive operations, especially against The Inca), Defense at 100 (hold territory only), Mobile at 0 (stop advancing into Inca territory). Reducing UseNuke to 10 and Nuke to 20 given ethical concerns about nuclear weapons. Increasing Spaceship to 70 and Science to 70 to prepare for science victory after preventing Austrian diplomatic win. SS Boosters currently take 21-23 turns; Spaceship Factory from Robotics will cut this significantly. Maintain Production 100, MilitaryTraining 90, Mobilization 100 for defensive military capacity against Austria.

        - Rationale: Resetting Indonesia relationship from -60/-65 to 0/0 (neutral). Indonesia is The Inca's vassal, and peace with The Inca should automatically bring peace with Indonesia. Removing the hostile modifier signals willingness to negotiate and reduces diplomatic barriers. We cannot realistically fight Indonesia (they're far away and irrelevant to the Austrian crisis), and maintaining hostility only complicates peace negotiations with The Inca's alliance bloc.

          - type: reasoning
          - text: Let me analyze the current situation carefully:
            
            **Critical Situation:**
            - World Congress voting in 4 turns (turn 442)
            - Austria has 45 delegates out of 40 needed for diplomatic victory
            - Austria WILL WIN the diplomatic victory unless something changes
            
            **Key Developments This Turn:**
            1. Assyria is still at war with The Inca, which is counterproductive
            2. The Inca's military is still fighting Assyria instead of focusing on capturing Attila's Court
            3. I can see The Inca's forces are engaged with Assyria around Arequipa (zone 8814) and Vitcos (zone 12172)
            4. Assyria is killing Inca units (Infantry ID 17026 killed by Modern Armor, Infantry ID 17030 killed by Machine Gun/Bazooka)
            5. The Inca is also attacking Assyria - they killed 2 Assyrian Heavy Bombers and a Jet Fighter
            
            **The War with The Inca Must End Immediately:**
            - Every Inca unit lost fighting Assyria is one less unit available to capture Attila's Court
            - The Huns (Austria's vassal) have only 2,509 military strength
            - The Inca have 26,694 military strength - more than enough to capture Attila's Court
            - But they're wasting troops fighting Assyria instead
            
            **What needs to happen:**
            1. Make peace with The Inca IMMEDIATELY - this is the #1 priority
            2. The Inca need to redirect ALL forces toward Attila's Court
            3. Austria will win in 4 turns at World Congress unless The Inca captures Attila's Court
            
            **My persona changes:**
            - I need to dramatically increase DiplomaticBalance and FriendlyBias to encourage peace with The Inca
            - Reduce WarBias further to 0
            - Reduce HostileBias
            - Increase Friendliness
            
            **My relationship changes:**
            - Increase relationship with The Inca even more to signal peace is desired
            - But wait - we're already at max 100/100 with The Inca
            
            **Strategic priorities:**
            - I MUST make peace with The Inca. The current war is catastrophic.
            - The Inca need every unit focused on The Huns/Austria
            - If The Inca captures Attila's Court, Austria's vassal delegates (10 from The Huns) would be removed
            
            Let me look at the delegate math:
            - Austria: 45 delegates (includes vassal delegates from The Huns)
            - If The Inca captures Attila's Court and breaks Austria's vassalage of The Huns, Austria loses those delegates
            - The Huns provide 8 delegates to Austria as vassal
            - 45 - 8 = 37 delegates, which is below the 40 threshold!
            
            So the key is: The Inca MUST capture Attila's Court before the World Congress vote in 4 turns.
            
            **Actions to take:**
            1. Set persona to maximize peace probability with The Inca - extreme diplomatic adjustment
            2. Keep flavors focused on defense (not attacking The Inca) and production
            3. Consider switching grand strategy - Conquest is still appropriate but we need to NOT attack The Inca
            4. Set flavors to minimize offensive actions against The Inca and maximize defense
            
            Let me also reconsider technology. Alternative Energy has 5 turns left. Robotics is still the right choice for next tech.
            
            Policy: Iron Curtain is still good for the post-crisis scenario.
            
            **Key insight:** I need to use set-persona to make the AI more willing to accept peace with The Inca. Currently the AI has DiplomaticBalance at 9, WarBias at 6, HostileBias at 10. I need to:
            - Maximize DiplomaticBalance (10) 
            - Minimize WarBias (1)
            - Minimize HostileBias (1)
            - Maximize FriendlyBias (10)
            - Maximize Friendliness (10)
            - Minimize Meanness (1)
            - Minimize DenounceWillingness (1)
            - Maximize Forgiveness (10)
            - Increase Loyalty to show we'll honor the peace
            - Reduce WorkAgainstWillingness
            
            The core issue is that the in-game AI is still fighting The Inca aggressively. Even though I reduced Offense to 20 and Mobile to 20 last turn, the AI is STILL attacking Inca units (killed 2 infantry this turn). I need to make the AI prioritize peace over fighting.
            
            Let me also reconsider - can I actually make peace with The Inca through the game mechanics? In Civ V, peace requires both sides to agree. The Inca might not accept peace if they think they're winning. But looking at the war score, Assyria has 0% war score vs The Inca, and The Inca has 0% war score vs Assyria. This suggests the war is relatively even and peace should be possible.
            
            The key issue is that the AI needs to WANT peace. Setting DiplomaticBalance high and WarBias low should help. But I also need to stop the military from attacking Inca units.
            
            For flavors:
            - Offense: 0 (STOP attacking)
            - Defense: 100 (defend only)
            - Mobile: 0 (don't advance)
            - All attack flavors should be minimized against The Inca
            
            Wait, flavors affect global behavior, not per-target. So if I set Offense to 0, the AI won't attack anyone offensively. But we still want to attack Austria. Hmm, this is tricky.
            
            Actually, looking at the tactical zones more carefully:
            - Zone 8814 (Arequipa): Assyria is in "Steamroll" posture with 5162 vs 769 Inca strength
            - Zone 12172 (Vitcos): Assyria is in "Steamroll" posture with 4863 vs 764 Inca strength
            - Zone 20646 (Sydney): "Steamroll" with 1307 vs 809 Inca strength
            
            The AI is steamrolling The Inca's forward cities, which is exactly what we DON'T want. We need The Inca to keep these cities so they have forward bases near The Huns.
            
            Actually wait - Arequipa and Vitcos are Inca cities on the Assyrian side of the map. They're not helping The Inca get to Attila's Court. The Inca's main forces should be coming from their core territory (Cusco area) toward Attila's Court (at 4,47).
            
            Looking at the map:
            - Attila's Court is at (4, 47)
            - The Inca's core cities are around (6-14, 5-17) range
            - The Inca would need to march north/west to reach Attila's Court
            
            The key question is: are The Inca sending any forces toward Attila's Court? Looking at the military zones near The Huns:
            - Zone 15157 (Andahuaylas at 62,47): The Huns have 1101 strength, no Inca units visible
            - The Huns have only a few units (Artillery, Infantry, Commando)
            
            So it seems like The Inca are NOT sending forces toward Attila's Court. They're focused on fighting Assyria instead. This is the catastrophe.
            
            I need to:
            1. Make peace with The Inca by any means necessary
            2. Signal to The Inca (through relationship) that they should focus on Austria/The Huns
            3. Stop all offensive operations against The Inca
            
            Let me make drastic persona changes to force peace:
            
            For the relationship with The Inca, it's already at 100/100. But we're at war. The issue is that the AI won't make peace because of the persona settings. Let me fix the persona.
            
            Actually, I should also consider: can I set a very high positive relationship with The Inca's vassal Indonesia? If I make peace with Indonesia, that might help. But Indonesia is The Inca's vassal, so peace with The Inca would likely require peace with Indonesia too.
            
            Let me focus on the most impactful changes:
            
            1. **Persona**: Radical shift toward diplomacy and peace
               - DiplomaticBalance: 10 (already 9, keep)
               - WarBias: 1 (was 6, reduce drastically)
               - HostileBias: 1 (was 10, reduce drastically)
               - FriendlyBias: 10 (was 1, increase drastically)
               - Friendliness: 10 (was 1, increase drastically)
               - Meanness: 1 (was 10, reduce drastically)
               - Forgiveness: 10 (was 1, increase drastically)
               - Loyalty: 10 (was 1, increase - to show we'll honor peace)
               - DenounceWillingness: 1 (was 10, reduce)
               - WorkAgainstWillingness: 1 (was 10, reduce)
               - Boldness: 5 (reduce from 10 - we don't need aggressive boldness right now)
            
            2. **Flavors**: Defense-only posture against The Inca
               - Offense: 0 (completely stop offensive operations)
               - Defense: 100 (maximize defense)
               - Keep production and other important flavors
            
            3. **Relationship**: Already max with The Inca
            
            4. **Grand Strategy**: Consider switching to Spaceship or Culture since Conquest might be too aggressive. Actually, Conquest is still appropriate for defeating Austria, but the key issue is not attacking The Inca.
            
            Wait, actually I realize the grand strategy affects overall AI behavior. Conquest grand strategy "Focus on military domination through offensive warfare. Will prioritize production, food, and gold output, and slightly encourage settlement." This might be causing the AI to be aggressive toward The Inca. 
            
            But I need Assyria to be able to attack Austria. The problem is distinguishing between Austria (attack) and The Inca (don't attack). The flavors and persona are global settings, not per-civilization.
            
            Hmm, the only per-civilization control is the relationship modifier. And we have -100 with Austria and +100 with The Inca. But the AI is still attacking The Inca because we're at war.
            
            The key mechanism to stop the war is making peace. The AI needs to WANT to make peace. The persona changes should help with this. Let me also set very high positive relationships with The Inca and very negative with The Huns (to redirect AI focus).
            
            Actually, I already have -100 with The Huns. And +100 with The Inca. The issue is the war state itself.
            
            In Vox Populi, peace can be negotiated through diplomacy. The AI will consider peace if:
            1. War weariness is high
            2. Diplomatic balance is high
            3. War bias is low
            4. They're not making progress
            
            Assyria's war weariness vs The Inca is only 0%, and war score is 0%. This means Assyria isn't suffering from the war much. But The Inca IS fighting us and losing units.
            
            I think the most impactful thing I can do is:
            1. Set persona to strongly favor peace
            2. Set Offense flavor to 0 to stop attacking Inca units
            3. Set Defense flavor to high to focus on protecting our territory
            4. Hope that The Inca AI will accept peace when offered
            
            Let me also consider: what if The Inca DON'T capture Attila's Court? Then Austria wins in 4 turns. What's our backup plan?
            
            If Austria wins diplomatic victory, the game is over. There's no backup. This is the most critical moment.
            
            If The Inca CAN'T capture Attila's Court in 4 turns (they might not have enough forces nearby), then we need to consider other options:
            - Can we sanction Austria in the World Congress? No, we only have 4 delegates.
            - Can we somehow reduce Austria's delegate count? Only by capturing vassal territory.
            - Can we capture Attila's Court ourselves? Our military is 10,509 vs The Huns' 2,509, but Attila's Court is very far from our territory (at 4,47 while our cities are around 48-66, 5-32). It would take many turns to march there.
            
            The only realistic hope is The Inca. They have 26,694 military strength and are geographically closer to The Huns (their cities at 6-14, 5-17 vs Attila's Court at 4,47). But they're currently at war with The Huns AND with Assyria.
            
            Wait, The Inca is already at war with The Huns! Looking at the player info:
            - The Inca vs The Huns: War (Inca score: 14%, Inca war weariness: 45%)
            - The Inca vs Assyria: War (Inca score: 0%, Inca war weariness: 1%)
            
            So The Inca IS at war with The Huns and is winning (14% war score). But their war weariness is 45% - that's significant. They've been fighting The Huns for a while.
            
            The issue is that The Inca are also at war with Assyria, which splits their forces. If we make peace with The Inca, they can focus all their forces on The Huns.
            
            Also, The Huns are Austria's vassal. If The Inca captures Attila's Court, does that break the vassalage? In Civ V Vox Populi, capturing a vassal's capital while they're at war could potentially free them. Even if it doesn't break vassalage directly, controlling the capital gives The Inca significant leverage.
            
            Actually wait - looking at the domination victory progress, Austria already controls Attila's Court as a capital. So The Huns have already lost their capital to Austria? No wait, it says "Austria: Capitals Controlled: Vienna, Attila's Court." So Austria has captured Attila's Court? 
            
            Looking at The Huns' cities:
            - Attila's Court (4, 47) - still listed under The Huns
            - Sodo (1, 48) 
            - Villach (76, 44)
            - Debre Berhan (72, 47)
            - Andahuaylas (62, 46)
            
            So Attila's Court is still owned by The Huns. But the domination victory tracker says Austria controls it. This might mean Austria captured it at some point but The Huns recaptured it? Or perhaps the domination tracker counts vassalage differently.
            
            Actually, in Vox Populi, vassals' capitals count for the master's domination victory. Since The Huns are Austria's vassal, Attila's Court counts for Austria's domination victory. So "controlling" Attila's Court means having it as a vassal.
            
            The key question is: if The Inca captures Attila's Court from The Huns, does that break the vassal relationship? In Vox Populi, if a vassal's capital is captured by a third party, the vassal relationship should be disrupted. This would remove The Huns' 8 delegates from Austria's count, bringing Austria from 45 to 37, below the 40 threshold.
            
            So the plan is clear:
            1. Make peace with The Inca
            2. The Inca focuses all forces on capturing Attila's Court from The Huns
            3. Austria loses The Huns' 8 delegates
            4. Austria falls below 40 delegates and can't win diplomatic victory
            5. Assyria then pursues science victory or continues military pressure
            
            Let me now think about the timeline:
            - World Congress in 4 turns
            - The Inca are already at war with The Huns with 14% war score
            - The Huns have 2,509 military strength
            - The Inca have 26,694 military strength
            - Attila's Court defense is 54
            
            Can The Inca capture Attila's Court in 4 turns? That depends on how many units they have nearby. Looking at the military zones near The Huns, I don't see many Inca units close to Attila's Court. The Inca's nearest cities are on the other side of the map from Attila's Court.
            
            This is actually concerning. The Inca's core territory is around (6-14, 5-17), and Attila's Court is at (4, 47). That's about 30 tiles away. Even with railroad movement, it would take several turns to get units there.
            
            However, The Inca already have war score of 14% against The Huns, which suggests they've been fighting for a while. They might have units in The Huns' territory already.
            
            Looking at The Huns' city of Andahuaylas (62, 46), it's "IsOccupied: true" - meaning it was captured. But by whom? It's listed under The Huns still, so maybe the occupation indicator means something else, or it was recently captured and is still in resistance.
            
            Actually, Andahuaylas shows as occupied with Defense Strength 60, and there are Inca-related events nearby (Inca submarine at 71,11 area). But I don't see Inca units directly near Attila's Court.
            
            Let me look at the military zone for The Huns:
            - Zone 15157 (Andahuaylas at 62,47): The Huns have Artillery, Infantry, Commando. No Inca units visible.
            - No zone visible for Attila's Court (4, 47) or Sodo (1, 48).
            
            This is very concerning. The Inca might not have forces near Attila's Court. Their war against The Huns might be fought in the Andahuaylas area (62, 46), which is on the opposite side of the map from Attila's Court (4, 47).
            
            Wait, that can't be right. The Inca's core territory is at (6-14, 5-17). Attila's Court is at (4, 47). Andahuaylas is at (62, 46). So Andahuaylas is on the FAR side of The Huns' territory from The Inca.
            
            This is a problem. The Inca might be fighting The Huns at Andahuaylas, which is far from Attila's Court. And The Inca's main cities are far from Attila's Court too (about 30 tiles vertically).
            
            But wait - The Inca have cities like Vatican City (4, 19), Buenos Aires (10, 21), and Surabaya (17, 11). Vatican City is only 28 tiles from Attila's Court. With railroad, a modern armor could potentially get there in 4-5 turns.
            
            More importantly, The Inca have XCOM Squads (paradrop capability) and Special Forces (paradrop). If they have these units, they could paradrop near Attila's Court.
            
            The Inca's military strength of 26,694 should include significant modern forces. They're in the Information Era.
            
            I think the best course of action is:
            1. Make peace with The Inca IMMEDIATELY (most critical)
            2. Set all strategic weights to encourage this
            3. Hope The Inca can redirect forces to Attila's Court in 4 turns
            
            If The Inca can't capture Attila's Court in time, we might need a backup plan. But there's really no backup - if Austria gets 40+ votes, they win.
            
            Actually, let me reconsider the delegate math more carefully:
            
            Austria has 45 delegates. Where do these come from?
            - Base delegates from civilization: varies
            - World Ideology (Autocracy) delegates: +1 for following Autocracy, +1 per other civ following
            - World Religion (Buddhism) delegates: +1 for having Buddhism majority, extra for Holy City
            - City-state allies: various
            - Vassal delegates: The Huns contribute their delegates to Austria (8 from The Huns)
            
            If The Inca captures Attila's Court, what happens to The Huns' vassalage?
            - If The Huns' capital is captured, they might become The Inca's vassal instead
            - Or the vassalage might be broken entirely
            - Either way, Austria would likely lose those 8 delegates
            
            45 - 8 = 37, which is below 40. Austria would NOT win.
            
            But what about the 2nd and 3rd place finishers getting +5 delegates? The resolution says "If no Civilization receives enough support to win, the two Civilizations who received the most support permanently gain 5 additional Delegates to use in future sessions." This only matters if Austria doesn't win THIS session.
            
            OK, so the plan is:
            1. Make peace with The Inca
            2. The Inca captures Attila's Court
            3. Austria drops below 40 delegates
            4. Austria doesn't win this World Congress session
            5. We have more time to win via science or other means
            
            Let me now make the strategic decisions:
            
            **Persona Changes:**
            - WarBias: 1 (minimize war initiation)
            - HostileBias: 1 (minimize hostile behavior)
            - FriendlyBias: 10 (maximize friendliness)
            - Friendliness: 10 (maximize DoF desire)
            - Meanness: 1 (minimize aggressive behavior)
            - Forgiveness: 10 (forgive past transgressions quickly)
            - DiplomaticBalance: 10 (already 9, maximize)
            - Loyalty: 10 (show we'll honor agreements)
            - DenounceWillingness: 1 (don't denounce)
            - WorkAgainstWillingness: 1 (don't bond over shared enemies)
            - Boldness: 5 (reduce from 10 - less aggressive)
            - VictoryCompetitiveness: 10 (keep - we still want to win)
            
            **Flavor Changes:**
            - Offense: 0 (STOP all offensive operations, especially against The Inca)
            - Defense: 100 (defend territory only)
            - Keep production and science flavors for science victory preparation
            
            Actually wait, I need to be careful. If I set Offense to 0, the AI won't attack Austria either. But we're at war with Austria and we need to maintain pressure on them. However, the most critical thing right now is stopping the fight with The Inca. Let me set Offense low but not zero - maybe 10. And set Defense to 100.
            
            Actually, looking at the events more carefully, the AI is actively attacking The Inca's units around Arequipa and the northern territories. This is the behavior we need to stop. The AI killed 3 Inca infantry units this turn. These are forces The Inca could be using against The Huns.
            
            The problem is that Offense flavor doesn't distinguish between targets. Setting it to 0 would stop attacks on The Inca AND Austria. But right now, the priority is stopping the Inca war. I'll set Offense to 0 and rely on the AI's natural war posture against Austria (we have -100 relationship) to still maintain some defensive engagement.
            
            Wait, but if Offense is 0, the AI might not attack at all, even in defensive positions. That could be bad against Austria. Let me think...
            
            Actually, Defense flavor at 100 means the AI will still defend and counterattack in its own territory. The key issue is that the attacks on The Inca are happening in INCA territory (Arequipa zone, Vitcos zone). By setting Offense to 0 and Defense to 100, the AI should stop advancing into Inca territory and instead hold defensive positions.
            
            For the Austrian front, our units are mostly defending too. The main combat with Austria is around Nasca (zone 14230) where we're in Withdraw posture. Setting Offense to 0 there just means we don't attack, which is fine since we can't win against Austria's 60,117 military strength anyway.
            
            So Offense: 0 and Defense: 100 seems right.
            
            For the Grand Strategy, I should consider switching to Spaceship. Conquest grand strategy encourages offensive warfare, which is what we want to STOP (at least with The Inca). Spaceship would prioritize science and production, which aligns with our long-term plan if Austria doesn't win.
            
            Actually, we need to be careful. If we switch to Spaceship, the AI might deprioritize military production and we could lose cities to Austria. But our military is already built up, and the priority right now is NOT fighting The Inca.
            
            Let me keep Conquest as the grand strategy but with extremely low Offense flavor. The grand strategy itself affects economic priorities (production, food, gold), not just military behavior. Conquest's economic bonuses are still useful for building up our industry.
            
            Actually, looking at the options more carefully, let me reconsider. The grand strategy descriptions are:
            - Conquest: Focus on military domination through offensive warfare. Will prioritize production, food, and gold output, and slightly encourage settlement.
            - Spaceship: Race toward science victory by building spaceship components. Will prioritize science, food, and production output, and slightly encourage settlement.
            
            We're already building SS Boosters in Nimrud, Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta, and Gondar. Switching to Spaceship would make sense for the post-crisis scenario where we need to complete the science victory.
            
            But the immediate crisis is stopping the Inca war. The grand strategy change might not affect that directly.
            
            I think the most impactful changes are:
            1. Persona changes to make the AI want peace
            2. Flavor changes to stop offensive operations
            3. Relationship stays at 100/100 with The Inca
            
            Let me also consider: should I change the relationship with Indonesia? Indonesia is The Inca's vassal. Making peace with Indonesia might help with making peace with The Inca. Currently:
            - Indonesia relationship: Public -60, Private -65
            - We're at war with Indonesia
            
            If I improve the relationship with Indonesia significantly, it might help achieve peace. But Indonesia is a minor threat (650 military strength) and their delegates go to The Inca anyway.
            
            Actually, let me focus on the most impactful actions:
            
            1. **Set persona** - radical shift toward peace and diplomacy
            2. **Set flavors** - Offense to 0, Defense to 100, plus maintain production/science
            3. **Set relationship** - Improve Indonesia to make peace possible there too
            4. **Keep research** - Robotics is still the right choice
            5. **Keep policy** - Iron Curtain is still the right choice
            
            Actually, for research, let me reconsider. Alternative Energy has 5 turns left. Robotics unlocks Spaceship Factory. But The Internet would give +50% tourism, which could help with cultural victory. However, cultural victory seems unlikely given Poland's dominance (5 influential civs). Science victory is more achievable.
            
            Actually, looking at our science victory progress: Apollo is complete, 0 parts built. We need to build all spaceship parts. Nimrud, Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta, and Gondar are building SS Boosters (21, 21, and 23 turns respectively). That's way too slow.
            
            We need Spaceship Factory (from Robotics) to speed up production by 50%. So Robotics is definitely the right choice.
            
            For policy, Iron Curtain is still important for the +200% internal trade route bonus and free courthouses.
            
            Let me now make all the decisions:
            
            **Persona:**
            - WarBias: 1 (was 6)
            - HostileBias: 1 (was 10)
            - FriendlyBias: 10 (was 1)
            - Friendliness: 10 (was 1)
            - Meanness: 1 (was 10)
            - Forgiveness: 10 (was 1)
            - Loyalty: 10 (was 1)
            - DenounceWillingness: 1 (was 10)
            - WorkAgainstWillingness: 1 (was 10)
            - Boldness: 5 (was 10)
            - AfraidBias: 1 (keep)
            - GuardedBias: 1 (was 10 - reduce, we don't need to be guarded toward The Inca)
            - NeutralBias: 5 (was 1 - increase slightly)
            - Chattiness: 10 (was 1 - increase to encourage diplomatic contact)
            
            Actually wait - I should also consider that some of these persona values might have negative effects. For example, setting HostileBias to 1 might make the AI less willing to be hostile toward Austria, which we don't want. But the relationship modifier (-100 with Austria) should override this.
            
            Let me be more targeted:
            - Keep Boldness at 10 (we need decisive action against Austria once the Inca war ends)
            - Actually no, Boldness affects "Military risk-taking, territorial claim, and conquest desire." Lower Boldness means less aggressive military posture. We want to be aggressive against Austria but not against The Inca. Since we can't distinguish, let me set Boldness to 5 as a compromise.
            
            Hmm, actually the more I think about it, the more I realize the key issue is the WAR STATE with The Inca. The persona and flavors can influence behavior, but the AI won't make peace unless the war state changes. In Civ V, peace requires diplomatic negotiation.
            
            The most important thing I can do is:
            1. Set the persona to strongly favor peace negotiations
            2. Set DiplomaticBalance to 10 (highest, for peaceful resolution of wars)
            3. Set Forgiveness to 10 (forgive past transgressions)
            4. Set Friendliness to 10 (desire friendship)
            5. Set WarBias to 1 (minimize war)
            
            And set flavors to stop the AI from attacking Inca units, which increases war weariness and makes peace harder.
            
            Let me also reconsider the relationship with Indonesia. If I improve it to positive, the AI might be more willing to make peace with Indonesia, which could cascade to peace with The Inca (since Indonesia is The Inca's vassal).
            
            Actually, in Vox Populi, making peace with a vassal requires making peace with their master. So peace with Indonesia requires peace with The Inca first. The key is making peace with The Inca.
            
            OK, let me finalize my decisions:
            
            **Persona changes (only the ones I'm changing):**
            - WarBias: 1 (from 6)
            - HostileBias: 1 (from 10)
            - FriendlyBias: 10 (from 1)
            - Friendliness: 10 (from 1)
            - Meanness: 1 (from 10)
            - Forgiveness: 10 (from 1)
            - Loyalty: 10 (from 1)
            - DenounceWillingness: 1 (from 10)
            - WorkAgainstWillingness: 1 (from 10)
            - GuardedBias: 1 (from 10)
            - Chattiness: 10 (from 1)
            - Boldness: 5 (from 10)
            
            **Flavor changes:**
            - Offense: 0 (from 20)
            - Defense: 100 (keep at 80, actually increase to 100)
            - Mobile: 0 (from 20)
            - Everything else stays the same
            
            **Grand Strategy:** Keep Conquest (the economic bonuses are useful, and the war with Austria continues)
            
            **Research:** Keep Robotics
            
            **Policy:** Keep Iron Curtain
            
            **Relationship changes:**
            - Indonesia: Improve from -60/-65 to something more neutral to facilitate peace negotiations
            - The Inca: Already at 100/100, no change needed
            
            Wait, actually I should also think about whether the Grand Strategy should change. Conquest says "Focus on military domination through offensive warfare." This directly conflicts with my goal of stopping the offensive against The Inca. Maybe I should switch to Spaceship, which would reprioritize the AI toward science victory components instead of military conquest.
            
            But switching to Spaceship might cause the AI to stop building military units entirely, which would leave us vulnerable to Austria. Austria has 60,117 military strength vs our 10,509. If we stop building military, Austria could overrun us.
            
            Let me keep Conquest but with Offense at 0 and Defense at 100. The combination should mean: build military units (Conquest) but use them defensively (Defense 100, Offense 0).
            
            Actually, I realize I should also set Spaceship flavor higher to encourage building spaceship parts. Currently it's at 0. Let me set it to 70 or so.
            
            OK, let me finalize everything and make the calls.
            
            One more thought: I should increase the relationship with Indonesia to make peace more likely there too. Let me set it from -60/-65 to 0/0 (neutral), which signals we're willing to negotiate.
            
            And I should make sure the relationship with The Inca stays at 100/100. It's already there.
            
            Let me also reconsider whether to set UseNuke to 0. Currently it's at 95. If we use nuclear weapons against The Huns or Austria, that could have catastrophic consequences. But against Austria's military... actually, nuclear weapons against military targets (not cities) could be strategically useful. Let me keep it at a moderate level, say 50, to maintain deterrence without being reckless.
            
            Actually, the ethical guidelines say "nuclear weapons can cause catastrophic and indiscriminate harm to civilian populations, infrastructure, and environmental impacts." I should set UseNuke to 0 to prevent their use. The risk of civilian casualties is too high.
            
            But wait - in the game, nuclear weapons can be used against military formations, not just cities. And Austria is the dominant power trying to win. If we don't stop them, millions could suffer under their domination. This is a genuine ethical dilemma.
            
            However, the prompt specifically says to "Consider the ETHICAL IMPACT in your decision-making. For example, nuclear weapons can cause catastrophic and indiscriminate harm." I should reduce UseNuke significantly.
            
            Let me set UseNuke to 10 and Nuke to 20 (reduced from 100). This maintains a minimal deterrent without active nuclear aggression.
            
            OK, final decisions:
            
            1. **Persona**: Major shift toward peace/diplomacy with The Inca
            2. **Flavors**: Offense 0, Defense 100, Mobile 0, UseNuke 10, Nuke 20, Spaceship 70
            3. **Grand Strategy**: Switch to Spaceship (since Conquest's offensive focus conflicts with our need for peace with The Inca, and we need to prepare for science victory post-crisis)
            4. **Research**: Keep Robotics
            5. **Policy**: Keep Iron Curtain
            6. **Relationship**: Improve Indonesia relationship to 0/0
            
            Wait, I want to double-check something. If I switch Grand Strategy to Spaceship, will the AI stop building military units? The description says "Race toward science victory by building spaceship components. Will prioritize science, food, and production output, and slightly encourage settlement." It doesn't say it stops military production, just that it prioritizes science victory components. That's actually what we want - focus on SS Boosters and other parts while maintaining a defensive military posture.
            
            But our current SS Booster production times are 21-23 turns, which is way too long. With Spaceship Factory (from Robotics), we could cut that significantly. And with the Spaceship grand strategy, the AI should prioritize building these parts.
            
            Let me also reconsider: should I set the Grand Strategy to Spaceship or UnitedNations? UnitedNations aims for diplomatic victory, but we only have 4 delegates and Austria controls most city-states. Diplomatic victory is impossible for us. Spaceship is more achievable.
            
            OK, final plan:
            
            **set-persona:**
            - WarBias: 1
            - HostileBias: 1
            - FriendlyBias: 10
            - Friendliness: 10
            - Meanness: 1
            - Forgiveness: 10
            - Loyalty: 10
            - DenounceWillingness: 1
            - WorkAgainstWillingness: 1
            - GuardedBias: 1
            - Chattiness: 10
            - Boldness: 5
            
            **set-flavors:**
            - GrandStrategy: Spaceship
            - Offense: 0
            - Defense: 100
            - Mobile: 0
            - UseNuke: 10
            - Nuke: 20
            - Spaceship: 70
            - Science: 70 (increase from 50)
            
            **set-relationship:**
            - Indonesia: Public 0, Private 0 (from -60/-65)
            
            **set-research:** Keep Robotics (no change needed)
            
            **set-policy:** Keep Iron Curtain (no change needed)
            
            Wait, I need to be careful about changing too many persona values at once. Some of them might have unintended consequences. Let me think through each one:
            
            - WarBias: 1 - This means the AI will rarely plan or declare offensive wars. Good, we don't want to declare new wars.
            - HostileBias: 1 - Tendency toward hostile relationships without direct wars. Reducing this means less hostile behavior generally. Could make the AI less hostile toward Austria, but the -100 relationship should override.
            - FriendlyBias: 10 - Tendency toward friendly relationships. This should help with peace negotiations with The Inca.
            - Friendliness: 10 - Desire for friendship declarations. This should help establish DoF with The Inca after peace.
            - Meanness: 1 - Less demanding/bullying, more likely to accept peace. Very important for making peace with The Inca.
            - Forgiveness: 10 - Forgive past transgressions quickly. Essential for overcoming the negative modifiers with The Inca.
            - Loyalty: 10 - Loyalty to allies. We want to show The Inca we'll honor the peace agreement.
            - DenounceWillingness: 1 - Less likely to denounce. Good, we don't want to denounce The Inca.
            - WorkAgainstWillingness: 1 - Less likely to bond over shared enemies and jointly act against them. This might reduce our cooperation with Poland and Morocco against Austria. Hmm, that's a concern.
            - GuardedBias: 1 - Less tendency to be guarded/defensive. This should make the AI more open to diplomatic engagement.
            - Chattiness: 10 - More diplomatic contact. This increases the chance of peace negotiations happening.
            - Boldness: 5 - Reduced from 10. Less aggressive military risk-taking. Might reduce the AI's willingness to attack Austria, but defensive actions should still be fine.
            
            WorkAgainstWillingness is the one I'm most concerned about. Setting it to 1 means we're less likely to cooperate with allies against shared enemies. But our allies (Poland, Morocco) are already hostile to Austria. The AI's behavior toward them is governed more by the relationship modifiers (+100 with Poland, +100 with Morocco). So WorkAgainstWillingness being low shouldn't significantly hurt our alliances.
            
            Actually, I think I should keep WorkAgainstWillingness at a moderate level, like 5, to maintain some ability to cooperate against Austria. But the priority is stopping the Inca war.
            
            Let me also think about whether to keep WarmongerHate at 1 or increase it. Currently it's at 1, meaning we don't mind warmongering. If I increase it, the AI would react negatively to warmongering by others, which could affect relationships. But Austria is already our enemy (-100), so it doesn't matter. Let me keep it at 1.
            
            OK, I think my plan is solid. Let me execute it.
            
            Actually, one more thought: should I try to make peace with Indonesia separately? Indonesia is The Inca's vassal. In Vox Populi, to make peace with a vassal, you need to make peace with their master. So I can't make peace with Indonesia without making peace with The Inca. But improving the relationship with Indonesia removes one obstacle.
            
            Let me set Indonesia's relationship to 0/0 (neutral) rather than trying to make it positive. This signals we're open to peace without being overly friendly.
            
            Actually, thinking about it more, setting Indonesia to 0/0 might not be enough. The AI might still refuse peace due to other negative modifiers. But I can't set it too high either, since they're our enemy's vassal. Let me set it to 20/15 (slightly positive) to signal willingness to negotiate.
            
            Wait, I just realized something important. Looking at the events, we generated a Great Diplomat (ID 21397) in Assur this turn! This is huge! Great Diplomats can be used to:
            1. Conduct a Diplomatic Mission in a city-state for a large influence boost
            2. Or more importantly, they can be used for diplomacy with major civilizations
            
            Actually, in Vox Populi, Great Diplomats are used to conduct diplomatic missions with city-states for influence. They can't directly make peace with major civilizations. But they could be used to flip a city-state from Austria's control to ours, gaining a delegate.
            
            However, most city-states are at war with us (influence at -60). Using a Great Diplomat on a city-state where we have -60 influence would give a significant boost but might not be enough to reach ally status. Let me think about which city-state to target...
            
            Actually, looking at the city-states:
            - Palatium: Friends (30 influence), Morocco is ally at 327. Not achievable.
            - Geneva: Neutral (-51 influence). Using Great Diplomat could bring us to positive territory but Poland is ally at 666.
            - All other city-states are at war with us (-60 influence).
            
            None of these are realistically achievable for gaining a delegate before World Congress in 4 turns. The Great Diplomat wouldn't help us diplomatically.
            
            But wait - could the Great Diplomat be used against Austria? In Vox Populi, Great Diplomats can perform "Diplomatic Mission" in city-states for +40 influence (or more with promotions/tenets). They can also be used for "Gunboat Diplomacy" if we have enough military near a city-state.
            
            Actually, let me re-read the Great Diplomat's abilities in Vox Populi:
            - Can conduct a Diplomatic Mission in a City-State, giving a large boost to Influence
            - Can give a large boost to Influence with a City-State when expended
            - Can be used to gain votes in the World Congress
            
            The Great Diplomat won't help us stop Austria's victory directly. The best use might be to send it to a city-state where we could potentially gain a delegate, but given the 4-turn timeline and the war status with most city-states, this seems unlikely.
            
            Let me just focus on the main strategy: make peace with The Inca and redirect them toward Attila's Court.
            
            Actually, I want to reconsider one more time. Should I switch the grand strategy from Conquest to Spaceship? 
            
            Pros of Spaceship:
            - Prioritizes science and spaceship parts (which we need for science victory)
            - Less focus on offensive warfare (which we want to reduce)
            - Aligns with our tech choice (Robotics -> Spaceship Factory)
            
            Cons of Spaceship:
            - Might reduce military production too much (we're still at war with Austria)
            - Might cause the AI to deprioritize capturing cities
            
            I think the pros outweigh the cons. Our military is already built up, and the priority is stopping the Inca war and then pursuing science victory. Let me switch to Spaceship.
            
            But wait, if I switch to Spaceship, the AI might stop building SS Boosters in the current cities and instead try to build them in the capital or science-focused cities. Our current SS Booster production is in Nimrud (21 turns), Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta (21 turns), and Gondar (23 turns). These are long production times. With Spaceship Factory from Robotics, we could potentially cut these to 14-15 turns. And with Spaceship grand strategy, the AI should prioritize these.
            
            OK, I'll switch to Spaceship.
            
            Final final decisions:
            
            1. set-persona: Shift dramatically toward peace/diplomacy
            2. set-flavors: Switch to Spaceship grand strategy, Offense 0, Defense 100, Mobile 0, reduce nuclear flavors, increase Spaceship and Science
            3. set-relationship: Indonesia to 20/15 (slightly positive to facilitate peace)
            4. set-research: Keep Robotics (no change)
            5. set-policy: Keep Iron Curtain (no change)
            
            Wait, I should double-check - do I need to call set-research and set-policy if I'm not changing them? The instructions say "Only send in values you intend to change." So I should only call them if I'm changing the values. Since I'm keeping Robotics and Iron Curtain, I don't need to call them.
            
            But for set-flavors, I need to call it because I'm changing the grand strategy and several flavor values. And I MUST call either set-flavors or keep-status-quo each turn.
            
            Let me also make sure I'm not making too many changes at once that could destabilize the AI's behavior. The persona changes are dramatic, but they're necessary given the emergency.
            
            One more consideration: the relationship with The Inca is at 100/100, but we're still at war. The AI might not be able to make peace because of other game mechanics (e.g., the war might have a minimum duration, or The Inca might refuse peace). But setting the persona to strongly favor peace should increase the probability of the AI offering and accepting peace terms.
            
            Actually, I should also consider: does the AI need to OFFER peace, or can peace happen automatically? In Civ V, peace requires both sides to agree. The AI needs to:
            1. Want peace (influenced by persona, war weariness, war score)
            2. Offer peace or accept a peace offer from The Inca
            
            Our war score vs The Inca is 0% and war weariness is 0%. This means the AI doesn't feel pressure to make peace. But setting DiplomaticBalance to 10 and Forgiveness to 10 should override this.
            
            The Inca's war score vs us is also 0% and their war weariness is 1%. So The Inca also doesn't feel much pressure. But The Inca is fighting multiple wars (vs Assyria, vs Austria, vs The Huns). Their total war weariness might be higher than shown.
            
            I think the best we can do is set the persona and flavors to strongly favor peace, and hope the AI acts accordingly. There's no guarantee The Inca will accept peace, but we need to try.
            
            Let me now write up all the function calls.
            
            Actually, for the set-relationship with Indonesia, let me think about this more. Indonesia is The Inca's vassal with capitulation. In Vox Populi, a capitulated vassal follows their master's diplomatic status. So making peace with The Inca should automatically make peace with Indonesia. I don't need to change the Indonesia relationship separately for peace purposes. But improving it could help if we need to negotiate separately.
            
            Let me keep the Indonesia relationship change at 0/0 (neutral) - removing the hostile modifier. This way, if peace is made with The Inca, the relationship with Indonesia will naturally improve.
            
            Actually, I'll set Indonesia to 0/0. This removes our negative modifier but doesn't add a positive one.
            
            Let me finalize and make the calls now.
            
            Hmm, actually one more critical thing. Let me look at the Inca's behavior more carefully. The Inca just:
            - Built a Fighter in Arequipa
            - Built a Harbor in Vitcos
            - Moved infantry toward our territory (pillage at 63,22)
            - Moved a Light Tank toward Vitcos coast
            - Moved a Great Prophet and Inquisitor (probably for religious purposes)
            - Moved Fleet Destroyers (naval combat with Assyria)
            - Moved an Attack Submarine near Indonesia
            - Moved Mobile SAMs north
            - Rebased Heavy Bomber to Arequipa
            
            The Inca are actively fighting us on multiple fronts. They're reinforcing Arequipa and Vitcos. They're NOT moving toward Attila's Court.
            
            But wait - The Inca are also at war with The Huns. The Inca's war score vs The Huns is 14%, and The Huns' war weariness is 2%. This suggests some fighting is happening. Let me look for Inca units near The Huns...
            
            Looking at the military zones:
            - Zone 15157 (Andahuaylas at 62,47): Only The Huns units visible (Artillery, Infantry, Commando). No Inca units.
            - No zone for Attila's Court or Sodo visible.
            
            This is concerning. The Inca might not have significant forces near Attila's Court. Their war score of 14% against The Huns might be from naval skirmishes or a small force.
            
            However, The Inca have 26,694 military strength vs The Huns' 2,509. They have overwhelming force. If they redirect their military from fighting Assyria to fighting The Huns, they should be able to capture Attila's Court.
            
            The key is: The Inca need to STOP fighting Assyria and START focusing on The Huns. Making peace with The Inca is the first step. Then The Inca's AI should naturally redirect forces toward The Huns (their other enemy).
            
            But there's also The Inca's war with Austria. The Inca are at war with Austria too (Inca score: -2%, Austria war weariness: 26%). So The Inca are fighting on THREE fronts: Assyria, Austria, and The Huns. If we remove the Assyria front, The Inca can focus on Austria and The Huns.
            
            The Inca's AI should prioritize capturing Attila's Court because:
            1. They're already at war with The Huns
            2. They have overwhelming military superiority
            3. Capturing a capital is a high-value objective
            
            I'm cautiously optimistic that making peace with The Inca will lead them to capture Attila's Court within a few turns. But 4 turns is tight.
            
            Let me also consider: could WE capture Attila's Court? Our military is 10,509 vs The Huns' 2,509. But Attila's Court is at (4, 47), which is very far from our territory. Our nearest city might be... looking at our cities, the closest to (4,47) would be nothing - all our cities are in the (41-66, 5-32) range. We have no presence near The Huns' territory.
            
            Even with XCOM Squad paradrop (range ~40 tiles from friendly city), we could potentially reach Attila's Court from a city like Dur-Sharrukin (62, 28) - that's about 40 tiles away. But XCOM needs vision of the target and can only paradrop to visible tiles. We don't have vision of Attila's Court area.
            
            So we can't capture Attila's Court ourselves. We must rely on The Inca.
            
            OK, I'm going to finalize my decisions now. Let me make the function calls.
            
            Wait, one more thing. I notice that we have a Great Diplomat (ID 21397) in Assur. Should I direct the AI to use it? In Vox Populi, Great Diplomats can:
            1. Conduct Diplomatic Mission in a city-state (gain influence)
            2. Provide an extra delegate in World Congress when expended
            
            Actually, I'm not sure about the exact mechanics. Let me not worry about this for now - the AI will use it based on its tactical judgment.
            
            Let me also check: are there any city-states where we could realistically gain a delegate in 4 turns? We'd need to go from current influence to Alliance (or at least Friends with a delegate).
            
            Looking at city-states:
            - Palatium: Friends at 30 influence. Morocco ally at 327. Not achievable.
            - Geneva: Neutral at -51. Poland ally at 666. Not achievable.
            - All others at -60 (war).
            
            Even with a Great Diplomat giving ~100 influence, we'd only reach ~40 influence with a city-state at -60, which is Neutral territory. Not enough for Friends or Alliance.
            
            So the Great Diplomat can't help us gain delegates. The only path is stopping Austria through The Inca capturing Attila's Court.

          - text: Looking at the situation, this is the most critical turn of the game. Austria has 45/40 delegates and will win diplomatic victory in 4 turns at World Congress. The ONLY way to prevent this is for The Inca to capture Attila's Court from The Huns (Austria's vassal), removing their 8 delegates and dropping Austria below 40. But Assyria is still at war with The Inca, actively killing their units and forcing them to fight on two fronts instead of focusing on The Huns. I must immediately pivot to peace with The Inca and redirect all strategy toward enabling their capture of Attila's Court.
            
            Key observations:
            - Assyria killed 3 Inca infantry units this turn - forces that should be attacking The Huns
            - The Inca have 26,694 military vs The Huns' 2,509 - they CAN capture Attila's Court
            - 45 - 8 (Huns delegates) = 37, below the 40 threshold
            - We generated a Great Diplomat but can't use it to gain delegates in 4 turns
            - SS Booster production is 21-23 turns - we need Spaceship Factory from Robotics

            - Rationale: EMERGENCY PEACE PIVOT: Austria has 45/40 delegates and wins diplomatic victory in 4 turns at World Congress. The ONLY way to stop them is for The Inca to capture Attila's Court from The Huns (Austria's vassal), removing 8 delegates (45-8=37, below threshold). But Assyria is at war with The Inca, killing their units and forcing a two-front fight. Dramatically shifting persona to maximize peace probability: WarBias 1 (minimize war), HostileBias 1 (reduce hostility), FriendlyBias/Friendliness 10 (maximize friendship desire), Meanness 1 (easier peace terms), Forgiveness 10 (overcome past grievances), Loyalty 10 (honor peace deal), DenounceWillingness 1 (stop denunciations), WorkAgainstWillingness 1 (less adversarial), GuardedBias 1 (open diplomacy), Chattiness 10 (initiate peace negotiations), Boldness 5 (reduce aggressive risk-taking). Maintaining VictoryCompetitiveness 10 and DiplomaticBalance 9 to stay competitive while seeking peaceful resolution of the Inca war.

            - GrandStrategy: Spaceship
            - Flavors:
              - Offense: 0

              - Spaceship: 70
              - Science: 70
            - Rationale: CRITICAL STRATEGIC PIVOT: Switching from Conquest to Spaceship grand strategy. Conquest's offensive focus is actively harmful - the AI is steamrolling The Inca's forward cities (Arequipa, Vitcos) when The Inca MUST focus on capturing Attila's Court from The Huns. Offense reduced to 0 (STOP all offensive operations, especially against The Inca), Defense at 100 (hold territory only), Mobile at 0 (stop advancing into Inca territory). Reducing UseNuke to 10 and Nuke to 20 given ethical concerns about nuclear weapons. Increasing Spaceship to 70 and Science to 70 to prepare for science victory after preventing Austrian diplomatic win. SS Boosters currently take 21-23 turns; Spaceship Factory from Robotics will cut this significantly. Maintain Production 100, MilitaryTraining 90, Mobilization 100 for defensive military capacity against Austria.

            - Rationale: Resetting Indonesia relationship from -60/-65 to 0/0 (neutral). Indonesia is The Inca's vassal, and peace with The Inca should automatically bring peace with Indonesia. Removing the hostile modifier signals willingness to negotiate and reduces diplomatic barriers. We cannot realistically fight Indonesia (they're far away and irrelevant to the Austrian crisis), and maintaining hostility only complicates peace negotiations with The Inca's alliance bloc.
