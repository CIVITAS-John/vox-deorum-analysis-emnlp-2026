  - rationale: URGENT RECALIBRATION: India Influential over 6/6 civs. Nuke/UseNuke maxed at 95 for immediate Great Works destruction via nuclear strikes when air superiority achieved. Air raised to 95 to achieve that superiority and conduct recon of Indian cultural sites. Antiair 80 counter potential Indian SAM sites. Offense/Mobile increased to 85/80 for aggressive India campaign while Greece distracts. Production/Science to 100 - PRIORITY for Apollo Program and spaceship parts racing India's potential final wonder. Espionage 95 to detect if India constructing Citizen Earth Protocol. Happiness 90 prevents war-weariness escalation during extended conflict if needed.

  - system:
    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - You can ask your specialized briefers to prepare focused reports (only for) the next turn by calling the `focus-briefer` tool.
        - You have three specialized briefers: Military, Economy, and Diplomacy analysts.
        - Only ask for information relevant to the macro-level decisions in your control. 
       - Your briefer(s) ONLY have limited information of the current game state.
        - Your briefer(s) DO NOT have control over tactical decisions and cannot predict tactical AI's next decision.
        - Your briefer(s) ARE BEST on summarizing and synthesizing factual information, NOT analyzing, projecting, or predicting.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.

        - Chattiness: 9
        - DeceptiveBias: 4
        - Rationale: Reducing from 10 to 9 because India's victory is not imminent as initially believed. India lacks Citizen Earth Protocol wonder, giving us strategic breathing room. Maintaining high competitiveness (9) preserves aggressive pursuit of science victory and continued military pressure on India, while allowing slightly more flexible diplomatic options with non-India players.
        
        ## Technology
        - Next: Satellites
        - Rationale: India's Cultural Victory is NOT imminent - missing Citizen Earth Protocol wonder. This creates opportunity to pursue Science Victory. Satellites enables Apollo Program construction (prerequisite for spaceship components). With our strong science output (1417 SPT) and healthy treasury (853G, 387 GPT), we can race for science victory while Greece/Inca apply military pressure on India. Electronics completes in 3 turns; positioning Satellites next ensures smooth progression to Apollo Program and spaceship construction.
        
        ## Policy
        - Next: None (Policy)
        
        ## Relationships
        
        ### The Zulus
        - Public: 52
        - Private: 40
        - Rationale: Public relationship increased from 40 to 52, private from 30 to 40. India (Player 4) is the world leader (Score 538, Medieval Era) with powerful economy (+41 GPT, 179G treasury). Strategic importance: 1) PRIME TRADE ROUTE TARGET for gold crisis solution - India's wealth can fund valuable caravans, 2) Distant position prevents border conflicts, supports lasting alliance, 3) UN coalition partner - India connects to multiple city-states including Trowulan (58 INF) we're targeting, 4) Counterweight to hostile Russia/Venice/Inca bloc, 5) Could potentially trade luxuries to address our happiness crisis (46%). Increasing to 52 public signals strong friendship approaching DoF levels. Private at 40 deepens trust. This positions us for trade route establishment and potential luxury trading once we connect our Lapis Lazuli/Horses luxuries.
        - UpdatedTurn: 117
        
        ### Oviedo
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 30
        - Rationale: Oviedo private relationship increased from 25 to 30. Oviedo is Germany-controlled city-state with 17 influence, needing +83 INF for Ally status. Strategic rationale: 1) Higher private score improves diplomat mission success when available, 2) Germany is our neutral-open partner - gradual diplomacy without confrontation, 3) Oviedo ally would provide second UN delegate when Statecraft completes (4/9 policies remaining), 4) Contesting Delhi-ally position requires long-term investment, not immediate confrontation with Germany. Small +5 increment maintains gradual approach while focusing diplomatic resources on India relationship and domestic economic recovery.
        - UpdatedTurn: 174
        
        ### America
        - Public: 38
        - Private: 30
        - Rationale: Increasing America relationship from Public 36 to 38 (unchanged private at 30). America is our strongest ally with DoF, currently at war with Russia and facing Russian Sanction America proposal in the World Congress (5 turns). Enhanced support positions us to: 1) Vote against Sanction America (supporting our DoF ally), 2) Maintain Washington's presence as counterweight to Russian aggression, 3) Preserve existing trade routes with America that help offset happiness crisis, 4) Send clear signal of Strong Friend solidarity in complex diplomatic geometry with Russia. Small increment reinforces alliance without risking Russian backlash on our India relationship.
        - UpdatedTurn: 203
        
        ### Trowulan
        - Public: 5
        - Private: 30
        - Rationale: Trowulan city-state (Player 23) relationship increased from Public 0/Private 30 to Public 5/Private 30. Strategic rationale: India is currently Ally with 353 influence, Greece at war (-60), and we have negative influence (-46) as Neutral. As a liberated city-state (former Oviedo territory), Trowulan presents an opportunity after America's defeat. While our immediate focus is Vatican City conversion, establishing a foothold with Trowulan positions us for future delegate acquisition. Small public increment (5) begins diplomatic engagement without over-commitment. Private score already at 30 (good for covert operations). This incremental approach preserves resources for Vatican City and Singapore (our current Ally, 384 INF) while planting seeds for expansion of our city-state network to catch Inca's delegate lead (4 vs 3).
        - UpdatedTurn: 233
        
        ### Vatican City
        - Public: 25
        - Private: 55
        - Rationale: Vatican City relationship increased from 20/50 to 25/55. Vatican is our current ally (458 INF) providing 3 critical UN delegates. Strategic rationale: (1) World Congress voting in 11 turns - solidifying delegate support is essential against Inca's 13-delegate lead. (2) Spy mission quest against Pachacuti available - higher private score (55) ensures maximum mission effectiveness. (3) Protestant majority quest shows religious alignment advantage in converting/maintaining ally status. (4) With several proposals pending (Incan Sphere, Open Door Trowulan, Venetian Sphere), consolidating our existing delegate base is priority before expanding to new city-states. (5) Small public increment signals continued priority while private score maximizes covert operation success.
        - UpdatedTurn: 294
        
        ### Venice
        - Public: 10
        - Private: 10
        - Rationale: Slightly increasing Venice from 5/5 to 10/10. Venice holds 9 WC votes (as Inca's voluntary vassal). Strategic value: (1) Coordinating Venice votes through Inca/DoF connection, (2) Venice already diplomatic client of Inca - enhancing our Venice relationship may improve Inca-Venice coordination, (3) Trade route income (232 GPT) remains important for gold economy, (4) Venice's 9 delegates could swing multiple votes if properly coordinated. Very small increment signals diplomatic priority while avoiding over-commitment to Inca's vassal.

        ### The Inca
        - Public: 35
        - Private: 35
        - Rationale: Maintaining Inca relationship at 35/35 for stable primary with military ally. Inca provides 13 WC votes, defensive pact, open borders, and DoF. They are at war with Russia (-98% score) but their military (1872 strength) is struggling - this war prevents Russia from supporting India's cultural victory. Our support through diplomatic/economic means (resources, coalitions) is optimal rather than direct war declaration that would spread our forces thinly. Inca-Greece combined pressure on Russia is key strategy to force Russia to cancel India DoF. No change needed - alliance stable.

        ### Greece
        - Public: 42
        - Private: 30
        - Rationale: Increasing Greece relationship from 40 to 42 (public). Greece (Player 2) is our critical ally with 24 WC votes and is currently at war with India (-14% score, 52% war weariness). Boosting our relationship encourages Greece to maintain war pressure on India, which could force India to divert cultural production toward defense. Greece also sponsoring Freedom ideology - we need coordination to ensure World Ideology votes don't inadvertently benefit India. Small increment reinforces alliance without over-commitment.

        ### Germany
        - Public: -32
        - Private: -30
        - Rationale: Germany (Player 6) relationship slightly more hostile at -32 public. Germany allied with India (DoF), actively supporting India's cultural victory by maintaining the friendship network. Increased hostility signals that Germany's support for India threatens global stability. No change to private (-30) - maintains espionage effectiveness. Focus remains on India elimination; Germany's diplomatic posture secondary.
        - UpdatedTurn: 418
        
        ### India
        - Public: -50
        - Private: -70
        - Rationale: India (Player 4) relationship deepened to maximum hostility (-50 public, -70 private). India cultural victory in 1 turn when Influential over Russia (99%). Maximum hostility ensures: 1) No diplomatic surrender possible, 2) Espionage against Indian cultural infrastructure maximized, 3) Nuclear strikes validated posture, 4) AI prioritizes total destruction of Indian cities (Delhi, Varanasi) over negotiated peace. Peace would still result in Indian victory unless eliminated or Great Works destroyed.
        - UpdatedTurn: 419
        
        ### Russia
        - Public: -25
        - Private: -30
        - Rationale: Russia marginally less hostile (-25 public from -30, private unchanged at -30). India becomes Influential over Russia in 1 turn, triggering Indian victory. This slight diplomatic opening attempts to signal willingness to coordinate against India - tiny probability Russia might abandon India DoF or take anti-India actions. Russia has largest military (8928) but is passive; any action before India's win could disrupt cultural victory. Priority remains Greece's anti-India war and science victory acceleration.
        - UpdatedTurn: 420
        
        ## Strategy
        - Rationale: Current strategic posture remains optimal. Spaceship grand strategy at 95 correctly prioritizes science victory path. Military flavors (Defense 65, Offense 70, Mobilization 95, Air 90) balance defense against India while enabling offensive support. Strong production (95), science (95), and gold (75) flavors support Apollo/spaceship construction. Diplomatic relationships stable: Greece (public 42) as anti-India ally, India at maximum hostility (-50/-70), Inca alliance solid. No substantive changes needed as we pivot from emergency prevention to active science victory competition.

        # Briefings
        ## Military Briefing
        **Zulu Military Briefing – Turn 423 (Post‑event)**  
        
        **1. Front‑line Situation – Indian War Front**  
        
        | City (Owner) | Zone ID | Coordinates (X,Y) | Current Garrison (Units) | Approx. Combat Strength* |
        |--------------|--------|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
        | **Delhi** (India) | 1060 (Land) | (40, 9) | • Artillery (1) – Strength 27, Ranged 50 | **≈ 77** |
        | **Varanasi** (India) – not listed as a separate zone this turn (city exists but no dedicated zone data). No Zulu‑visible enemy units reported within its immediate zone. | – | – | – | – |
        | **Delhi (City‑Tile)** – also hosts a **Bomber** (Air unit) stationed in the same zone (see Event 423‑7: India produced a **Caravan**, no Bomber change). | – | – | – | – |
        
        *Strength values are taken from the unit‑stat tables; promotions are not reflected in the current data.
        
        **Key Change Since Turn 418:**  
        - The **Delhi zone (1060)** now contains an **Indian Artillery unit** (previously the zone was listed without enemy units). The strength estimate rises to ~77, matching the previous estimate.  
        - No new Indian AA units have appeared in the Delhi zone; Varanasi remains without a reported zone, implying no immediate enemy presence detectable by the Zulu AI.
        
        **2. Zulu Air Assets – Paratrooper & Bomber Availability**  
        
        - **Paratrooper:** 1 Paratrooper remains in **Nodwengu** (city 9570). No change from Turn 418.  
        - **Bomber (Carrier for Paratrooper):** 1 Bomber (Triplane ID 17486) has been **re‑based** to **Nodwengu** (Event 423‑11). This Bomber now serves as the transport platform for the Paratrooper.  
        
        **Distance from Nodwengu to Delhi:** ~ 28 tiles (straight‑line).  
        **Distance from Nodwengu to Varanasi:** ~ 33 tiles (estimated; Varanasi not explicitly zoned).  
        
        **Air‑defence Situation Near Targets:**  
        - No AA units are reported in the Delhi zone.  
        - No AA units are reported in any zone adjacent to Delhi.  
        
        **Implication:** Air‑drop risk remains low for Delhi; Varanasi still lacks explicit zone data, but no AA presence has been detected.
        
        **3. Naval Force Posture – Battleships & Escorts**  
        
        | Sea‑Zone (ID) | Primary Naval Units (Zulu) | Supporting Units | Approx. Strength* |
        |---------------|----------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
        | **‑1455** (Umgungundlovu Sea‑Zone) | 4 Battleships | 2 Fleet Destroyers, 2 Riflemen | **≈ ~ 400** total (Battleship 60 + Ranged 75 each) |
        | **‑8308** (Nodwengu Sea‑Zone) | 1 Battleship | – | **≈ 60** |
        | **‑1078** (Vienna Sea‑Zone) | 1 Battleship | – | **≈ 60** |
        | **‑17712** (Agra Sea‑Zone) | 2 Dreadnoughts | – | **≈ 130** (50 + Ranged 65 each) |
        | **‑2475** (Corihuayrachina Sea‑Zone) | 1 Dreadnought | – | **≈ 50** |
        | **‑9570** (Nodwengu Sea‑Zone) | 1 Fleet Destroyer, 1 Cruiser, 1 Dreadnought | – | **≈ ~ 155** |
        | **‑1068** (Shanghai Sea‑Zone) | 1 Special Forces (no naval strength) | – | – |
        
        *Strength values are summed from unit‑stat tables; exact totals vary with promotions (not shown).
        
        **Key Change Since Turn 418:**  
        - The **Umgungundlovu sea‑zone (‑1455)** now fields **4 Battleships** (previously 4 Battleships were reported, unchanged).  
        - Additional **Fleet Destroyer** and **Cruiser** appear in **‑9570** (Nodwengu sea‑zone) – a new naval grouping not present in the previous briefing.  
        - No battleships are positioned within striking range of Indian coastal cities (India possesses no accessible coastal cities near the front), so naval fire support remains unavailable for the Indian campaign.
        
        **4. Land Force Distribution – Zone Strength Overview**  
        
        | Zone (City) | Dominance | Friendly Strength | Enemy Strength | Neutral Strength |
        |-------------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|
        | **Ulundi** (1082) | Friendly | 5,698 | – | 406 |
        | **Umgungundlovu** (1455) | Friendly | 6,699 | – | – |
        | **Nobamba** (1847) | Friendly | 3,745 | – | 440 |
        | **Bulawayo** (2018) | Friendly | 2,179 | – | 373 |
        | **Antwerp** (1067) | Friendly (Neutral zone) | 4,099 | – | 323 |
        | **M'banza‑Kongo** (1071) | Friendly (Neutral zone) | 1,734 | – | 203 |
        | **Corihuayrachina** (2475) – Enemy | Enemy | 441 | 844 | 766 |
        | **Huamanga** (2943) – Enemy | Enemy | 572 | 1,306 | 588 |
        | **Delhi** (1060) – Enemy | Enemy | – | 1,207 (Artillery 1) | 200 |
        
        **Key Developments Since Turn 418:**  
        - The **Delhi zone (1060)** now shows an **enemy Artillery unit** (strength 27/50). This presence was absent in the prior briefing, indicating a modest increase in Indian defensive firepower.  
        - No new enemy units have appeared in other Zulu‑adjacent zones.  
        - Zulu land forces continue to dominate all own zones, with total friendly strength across zoned cities exceeding 30,000 combat points, well above any neighboring enemy concentrations.
        
        **5. Recent Combat Events (Turn 422‑423)**  
        
        - **Russian Submarine Engagements (Turn 422):** Three combat results involving Russian Attack Submarines (unit ID 17165) resulted in the submarines taking damage and ultimately being destroyed. No Zulu units were involved.  
        - **Inca / Venice Ground Combat (Turn 423):**  
          - Two engagements at **Corfu (City 2648)** resulted in heavy damage to the defending Venetian **Machine Gun** unit (remaining HP ≈ 37).  
          - An engagement at **Corihuayrachina (City 2475)** saw the Inca **Anti‑Aircraft Gun** destroyed (remaining HP 0).  
          - An engagement at **Cusco (City 1059)** resulted in the Inca **Anti‑Aircraft Gun** being eliminated (remaining HP 0).  
        - **Indian Land Combat (Turn 423):**  
          - A **Rifleman** in **Delhi** took damage (remaining HP 35).  
          - A **Landship** in **India** (presumably near Delhi) sustained damage (remaining HP 18).  
        - **Zulu Unit Re‑base (Turn 423‑11):** A **Triplane** (DefenceAir) was re‑based to **Nodwengu** (city 9570). This reinforces air presence at the southern coastal city.  
        
        **6. Supply & Production Snapshot**  
        
        - **Military Units:** 75 total; **Military Supply:** 74 (near full supply).  
        - **Gold:** 1,610; **Gold/Turn:** +501 (strong economy, supporting continued production).  
        - **Production Queues:**  
          - Several cities (Ulundi, Umgungundlovu, Nobamba, Kwadukuza, Nongoma, Ondini, Nodwengu) are engaged in **Public Works** or **Strategic Defense System** projects, indicating a focus on infrastructure and defense.  
          - **Bulawayo** will complete its **Strategic Defense System** this turn.  
          - **Agra** (occupied) is producing a **Hotel**; no military units are queued there.  
        
        **7. Comparison to Turn 418 Briefing**  
        
        | Aspect | Turn 418 | Turn 423 | Δ / Notable Change |
        |--------|----------|----------|--------------------|
        | **Delhi Enemy Garrison** | Not explicitly listed (no enemy units shown) | Artillery (1) present (strength 27/50) | Added defensive firepower for India |
        | **Paratrooper Transport** | Bomber unspecified; Paratrooper at Nodwengu | Bomber (Triplane) re‑based to Nodwengu | Clear transport platform now confirmed |
        | **Naval Assets** | 4 Battleships (Umgungundlovu), 2 Dreadnoughts (Agra), assorted escorts | Same battleships plus new **Fleet Destroyer, Cruiser** in sea‑zone ‑9570 | Incremental increase in naval firepower, still out of range of Indian front |
        | **Land Zone Strength** | Zulu zones dominated; enemy zones limited | Same dominance; new enemy Artillery in Delhi; Inca AA units destroyed in separate combats | Minor shift in enemy composition; Zulu dominance unchanged |
        | **Combat Events** | No specific combat recorded in brief | Multiple combats: Russian submarines destroyed, Inca/Italian units damaged/killed, Indian Rifleman damaged, Zulu Triplane re‑based | Activity increased, but no direct Zulu‑enemy engagements reported |
        | **Supply** | Not detailed | Military Supply 74/75 (near full) | Supply remains strong |
        
        **8. High‑Level Observations**  
        
        - **Force Balance:** Zulu friendly strength (≈ 30k) vastly exceeds the highest single enemy zone strength (Russia ≈ 15.6k, India ≈ 1.9k, Inca ≈ 1.3k).  
        - **Front‑line Pressure:** The only immediate enemy presence on the Indian front is the Artillery unit in Delhi; no AA or ground units threaten Zulu air operations.  
        - **Air Capability:** A single Bomber (Triplane) is now positioned at Nodwengu, enabling potential air‑lift of the lone Paratrooper to Delhi.  
        - **Naval Reach:** All Zulu capital ships remain far from any Indian coastal objectives; naval fire support cannot influence the Indian campaign at this stage.  
        - **Logistics:** Military supply is near maximum; gold income is healthy, allowing continued production of both land and naval units without immediate economic strain.

        ## 1. Empire‑wide Macro‑Economics (Turn 423)
        
        | Metric | Current Value (Turn 423) | Δ vs. Turn 418* | Comment |
        |--------|--------------------------|----------------|---------|
        | **Gold Treasury** | **1 610 G** | **+ 514 G** | Gold surplus continues to grow thanks to strong internal production and profitable trade‑routes. |
        | **Gold / turn (net)** | **≈ 501 G/t** (≈ 620 G/t income – ≈ 119 G/t upkeep) | **+ ≈ 266 G/t** | Net gold income has rebounded sharply: new **Gold‑for‑resource** deals (Inca, Venice, Greece) and the end of several outbound routes that were draining gold. Unit‑maintenance cost remains low thanks to the 50 % discount. |
        | **Production / turn** (all cities) | **≈ 1 489 P/t** | **+ ≈ 215 P/t** | New **Strategic Defense System** (Bulawayo) and **Airport** (Nodwengu) finished; additional factories and improvements raise overall output. |
        | **Science / turn** | **≈ 1 450 S/t** | **+ ≈ 145 S/t** | **Electronics** research (≈ 2 turns to finish) is now boosted by Great‑Merchant routes (+ 7.5 S/t each) and the newly‑completed **Research Lab** in several cities. |
        | **Culture / turn** | **≈ 1 318 C/t** | **+ ≈ 331 C/t** | New **Wire Service** (Ulundi) and **Broadcast Tower** yields, plus extra Great Works, increase cultural output markedly. |
        | **Tourism / turn** | **≈ 617 T/t** | **≈ 0 T/t** | Tourism remains steady; the recent conversion of Kwadukuza and Nongoma to Protestantism adds a small bump, offset by the slight dip in culture growth earlier. |
        | **Faith / turn** | **≈ 235 F/t** | **+ 66 F/t** | Conversions of Kwadukuza and Nongoma to Protestantism now generate Faith per turn; modest increase. |
        | **Happiness %** | **≈ 54 % (Happy)** | **+ 5 %** | New luxury‑resource trades (Perfume, Ivory, Salt, Deer) and a **Hotel** in Nongoma raise happiness, removing the combat penalty. |
        | **Military Strength** | **5 656** (75 units, supply 74) | **‑ ≈ 200** | Slight reduction in unit count after a few older units were disbanded; overall strength still well above rivals. |
        | **Era** | **Atomic** – **Electronics** research (≈ 2 turns left) | **+ ≈ 6 turns** | Science dip reversed; on schedule to finish Electronics before the next era jump. |
        | **Trade‑route net gold** | **≈ + 230 G/t** (inbound ≈ + 170 G/t, outbound ≈ ‑ 40 G/t) | **+ ≈ 90 G/t** | New inbound routes from **Venice** city‑states (Cattaro, Venice, Singapore) bring higher gold; most outbound routes are now short‑term and nearing completion. |
        | **Trade‑route net science** | **≈ + 70 S/t** (inbound ≈ + 55 S/t, outbound ≈ ‑ 15 S/t) | **+ ≈ 15 S/t** | Continued Great‑Merchant yields; small outbound loss from a few routes that are ending. |
        | **Trade‑route net culture** | **≈ + 38 C/t** (inbound ≈ + 30 C/t, outbound ≈ ‑ ‑ 8 C/t) | **+ ≈ 34 C/t** | New cultural yields from inbound Venice routes and the **Wire Service** building. |
        
        \*Δ is the net change since the previous briefing (Turn 418). All figures are rounded.

        ## 2. Resource Position (Turn 423)
        
        | Resource | Stock | Immediate Need / Note |
        |----------|-------|-----------------------|
        | **Coal** | **‑3** (deficit) | Still required for **Factory** and **Railroad** upgrades; consider purchasing or trading (India has Coal). |
        | **Uranium** | **8** | Sufficient for a **Nuclear Power Plant** (1) and future **Nuclear Missile** projects. |
        | **Aluminum** | **17** | Covers upcoming **Carrier** (12) and **Battleship** (6) construction. |
        | **Iron** | **2** | Enough for a few **Impi**; surplus not critical now. |
        | **Oil** | **0** | No oil‑based units currently planned. |
        | **Luxury resources** (Perfume 1, Ivory 2, Salt 5, Deer 8, etc.) | **Stable** | Actively traded for Gold; happiness bolstered. |
        | **Strategic resources** (Copper 1, Lapis 1) | **Minimal** | Not needed for current production queue. |

        ## 3. Recent Economic Events (Turn 423)
        
        | Event | Economic Impact |
        |-------|-----------------|
        | **Kwadukuza** & **Nongoma** converted to **Protestantism** (Turn 423) | Adds Faith per turn (+ ~ 30 F/t each) and improves happiness via religious bonuses. |
        | **New city – Nodwengu** created (Turn 423) | Immediate production boost (+ ≈ 120 P/t) and extra science/culture from its **Research Lab** and **Factory** improvements. |
        | **Mine improvement** on Plains‑Hills 7,45 completed | Small increase in production (+ ≈ 4 P/t) and yields for the adjacent city. |
        | **Hotel built in Nongoma** (Turn 423) | Provides extra Gold (+ ≈ 8 G/t) and happiness (+ 2 %). |
        | **Golden Age extended** (10 turns remaining) | + 25 % production, gold, and science during the remaining GA turns; current GA effects are still active. |
        | **World Congress voting in 9 turns** – Zulus hold **8 delegates** (≈ 18 % share) | Gold surplus grants flexibility to purchase additional influence if critical votes arise. |
        | **Sanctions on Russia & India** – no Zulu routes with them | No loss of income; all Zulu trade routes are with **Venice**, **city‑states**, or **friendly** civs. |
        | **Open Door on Zuunmod** – already active | Stabilises influence; no impact on income. |
        | **Zulu Sphere of Influence proposal for M'banza‑Kongo** (active since Turn 421) | If passed, will secure a permanent ally and a permanent **Gold** stream (+ 24 G/t) plus resource exchange. |
        | **City‑state Deals** – continued gold‑for‑luxury swaps (Venice, Greece, India) | Keeps luxury resource stock adequate, supports happiness, and adds net gold (+ ≈ 30 G/t). |
        
        ---
        
        ## 4. Settlement Opportunities (Unchanged)
        
        | Location | Distance from nearest city | Quality | Strategic Value |
        |----------|----------------------------|---------|-----------------|
        | **(72, 33)** | 19 tiles | **96 %** | Highest‑quality site on a **new continent** near Germany (11 tiles). Ideal for a **Harbor/Port**, future **Naval Yard**, and high‑yield interior tiles. |
        | **(11, 48)** | 6 tiles | **47 %** | Moderate yields; near existing coastal cities, suitable for a **resource‑rich** settlement (wheat, deer, luxury). |
        | **(10, 47)** | 4 tiles | **22 %** | Low‑mid quality; useful only for strategic positioning (choke point). |
        | **(9, 47)** | 4 tiles | **10 %** | Very low yields; not recommended unless needed for defense. |
        | **(3, 50)** | 5 tiles | **0 %** | Poor yields; only consider as a defensive outpost. |
        
        *Recommendation:* The **96 %** site at (72, 33) remains the premier long‑term investment, offering both high tile yields and naval development potential. The **47 %** site at (11, 48) is the next best option for immediate resource expansion and a modest new city.
        
        ---
        
        ## 5. Diplomatic & Trade Context (Economic Lens)
        
        * **World Congress** – voting in 9 turns; Zulus hold **8 delegates** (≈ 18 %). Treasury surplus allows purchase of additional influence if a decisive vote is required.  
        * **Sanctions on Russia & India** – block any trade or corporation franchises with those civs; all Zulu routes remain with **Venice**, **city‑states**, or **friendly** parties, so no direct loss.  
        * **Open Door (Zuunmod)** – already active; stabilises influence levels with that city‑state.  
        * **City‑state deals** – ongoing gold‑for‑luxury exchanges (Venice, Greece, India) keep luxury resources sufficient and boost happiness.  
        * **Proposed Zulu Sphere of Influence (M'banza‑Kongo)** – pending; successful enactment locks a high‑value ally, delivering a permanent **gold** boost (+ 24 G/t) and securing additional resource flow.  
        
        ---
        
        ## 6. Summary of Economic Position (Turn 423)
        
        * **Liquidity:** Treasury now at **1 610 G**, with a healthy net gold income (**≈ 501 G/t**). Gold flow has recovered from the earlier deficit.  
        * **Production:** Strong increase (**≈ 1 489 P/t**), thanks to newly finished industrial buildings (Strategic Defense System, Airport, Wire Service) and the new city **Nodwengu**.  
        * **Science:** Positive swing (**≈ 1 450 S/t**) putting Electronics within two turns of completion; Great‑Merchant routes remain a reliable science source.  
        * **Culture/Tourism:** Culture has surged (**≈ 1 318 C/t**) keeping the Zulus competitive in the cultural race; tourism stays steady above 600 T/t.  
        * **Faith:** Faith generation rebounded after city‑state conversions, supporting future religious quests.  
        * **Happiness:** Now **≈ 54 %**, moving back into the **Happy** range; luxury trades and new **Hotel** have removed the combat penalty.  
        * **Military:** Slight reduction in unit count but overall strength remains solid; 50 % unit‑maintenance discount continues to protect gold.  
        * **Expansion:** One premium settlement spot (72, 33) on a new continent offers a long‑term economic windfall; a secondary mid‑quality site (11, 48) is viable for short‑term growth.

        ### 1. Major Diplomatic Developments (since Turn 418)
        
        | Civilization / City‑State | Change Since 418 | Current Relationship & Status |
        |---------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|
        | **India** | War continues; our war‑score is now **+10 %** (was +12 % at 418) and **war weariness 11 %** (up from 6 %). No new diplomatic actions. | **War** – **Denounced** each other. |
        | **Russia** | No new actions; still **Denounced** and under **World‑Congress sanctions** (no trades, deals, corp. franchises). | **Denounced** – **Sanctioned**. |
        | **Germany** | Peace treaty still in effect (expires in 2 turns). No new border opening or pact. | **Peace Treaty** (close). |
        | **Greece** | No change; open borders remain (distant). | **Open Borders**. |
        | **The Inca** | Defensive pact, open borders and friendship unchanged. | **Defensive Pact**, **Open Borders**, **Friendship** (neighbors). |
        | **Venice** | Open borders and friendship unchanged (neighbors). | **Open Borders**, **Friendship**. |
        | **City‑State – Oviedo** | Remains **Ally (protected)**; influence unchanged at **1,061**. | **Ally (protected)**. |
        | **City‑State – M'banza‑Kongo** | Still **Ally (protected)**; influence **346**. | **Ally (protected)**. |
        | **City‑State – Tyre** | Influence unchanged at **18**; now **Neutral (protected)** rather than Ally. | **Neutral (protected)**. |
        | **City‑State – Melbourne** | Influence unchanged at **181**; remains **Friend**. | **Friend**. |
        | **City‑State – Trowulan** | Influence unchanged at **205**; remains **Friend**. | **Friend**. |
        | **City‑State – Quebec City** | Influence unchanged at **73**; remains **Friend**. | **Friend**. |
        | **City‑State – Antwerp** | Influence unchanged at **381**; remains **Friend**. | **Friend**. |
        | **City‑State – Segou** | Influence unchanged at **97**; remains **Friend**. | **Friend**. |
        | **City‑State – Kathmandu** | Influence unchanged at **176**; remains **Friend (protected)**. | **Friend (protected)**. |
        | **City‑State – Vienna** | Influence unchanged at **92**; remains **Friend (protected)**. | **Friend (protected)**. |
        | **City‑State – Lutetia** | Influence unchanged at **28**; remains **Neutral (protected)**. | **Neutral (protected)**. |
        | **City‑State – Antananarivo** | Influence unchanged at **244**; remains **Friend (protected)**. | **Friend (protected)**. |
        | **City‑State – Shanghai** | Influence unchanged at **53**; remains **Friend**. | **Friend**. |
        | **City‑State – Zuunmod** | Open‑Door resolution forces influence to **40** (Friend). No other change. | **Friend (Open‑Door)**. |
        
        **Key points**
        
        * The war with India has **tightened** – war‑weariness up from 6 % to 11 %, and our war‑score slipped slightly, indicating a more contested front.  
        * No new diplomatic pacts, denouncements, or declarations of friendship have arisen since the last brief.  
        * Relationship with **Tyre** downgraded from Ally to Neutral (still protected) – no influence change, but the diplomatic status shift may affect future voting blocs.  
        * All other major civ relations remain as previously recorded.

        ### 2. World Congress Activity (voting in 9 turns)
        
        | Item | Status |
        |------|--------|
        | **Delegates (Zulus)** | **8** (≈ 18 % of total) – unchanged since 418. |
        | **Active Resolutions** | • Sanction: **Russia**  <br>• Sanction: **India**  <br>• **Global Peace Accords**  <br>• **Incan Sphere of Influence** – Kathmandu (available)  <br>• **Greek Sphere of Influence** – multiple city‑states (available)  <br>• **Zulu Sphere of Influence** – M'banza‑Kongo (available, our own)  <br>• **Travel Ban**  <br>• **Scholars In Residence**  <br>• **World Ideology: Freedom** |
        | **Proposals on the agenda** | 1. **Enact – Zulu Sphere of Influence: M'banza‑Kongo** (our own)  <br>2. **Repeal – Incan Sphere of Influence: Kathmandu** (sponsored by Greece)  <br>3. **Enact – United Nations** (sponsored by Greece)  <br>4. **Enact – World Ideology: Freedom** (sponsored by Greece) |
        | **Contender for highest delegate count** | **Greece** – still leads with **24** delegates. |
        | **Delegate distribution (major players)** | Greece 24 (54 %) | Inca 18 (38 %) | Germany 6 (13 %) | India 7 (15 %) | Russia 3 (6 %) | Venice 13 (31 %) | Zulus 8 (18 %) |
        
        **Implications**
        
        * Our **8 delegates** remain insufficient to pass resolutions alone; cooperation with either Greece’s dominant bloc or the Inca’s sizable bloc is still required.  
        * The **Zulu Sphere‑of‑Influence** proposal is the **only new legislative item** we have placed before the Congress; its passage would make our current ally M'banza‑Kongo a permanent ally.  
        * The **United Nations** proposal, if adopted, will eventually grant extra delegates and a free Great Diplomat – a potential long‑term boost once the Atomic Era is fully realized.

        | **Zuunmod** | 40 (forced) | Friend (Open‑Door) | — |
        | **Other city‑states** (Melbourne, etc.) retain influence levels and quest timers as previously reported. |
        
        **Notable updates**
        
        * **Tyre** has shifted from Ally to Neutral (still protected).  
        * No influence changes for any city‑state since Turn 418.  
        * All quest timers have decreased by five turns; no quest has been completed or failed yet.

        ### 4. Religion Overview
        
        | Civilization | Dominant Religion | Recent Changes |
        |--------------|-------------------|----------------|
        | **The Zulus** | **Protestantism** (state religion) | Two additional cities (**Nongoma** and **Kwadukuza**) confirmed as Protestant (city‑conversion events at Turn 422). No missionary pressure from other civs. |
        | **Russia** | Mixed (Hinduism, Protestantism, Eastern Orthodoxy) | No new conversions. |
        | **India** | Hinduism | No change. |
        | **Greece** | Eastern Orthodoxy | No change. |
        | **The Inca** | Catholicism | No change. |
        | **Venice** | Buddhism | No change. |
        
        **Summary** – Protestantism is now present in **six** Zulu cities, further consolidating religious unity. Other civs show no religious activity affecting us.

        ### 5. Comparison to Turn 418 Brief
        
        | Category | Turn 418 | Turn 423 | Δ / New Information |
        |----------|----------|----------|---------------------|
        | **War status** | War with India (score +12 %, weariness 6 %). | War with India (score +10 %, weariness 11 %). | War weariness increased; slight dip in war score. |
        | **Allied city‑states** | Allies: Oviedo, M'banza‑Kongo, Tyre (protected). | Allies: Oviedo, M'banza‑Kongo (protected). Tyre downgraded to Neutral (protected). | Loss of Ally status with Tyre. |
        | **World‑Congress delegates** | 8 delegates. | 8 delegates (unchanged). | No change. |
        | **World‑Congress proposals** | 4 proposals (incl. Zulu Sphere‑of‑Influence). | Same 4 proposals; no new items. | No additional proposals. |
        | **City‑state influence** | Values listed above; all static. | Same influence values; all quests still active with reduced timers. | No influence shifts. |
        | **Religion** | Protestantism in four Zulu cities. | Protestantism now in six Zulu cities (Nongoma, Kwadukuza added). | Expanded religious uniformity. |
        | **Espionage** | Indian spy detected in Bulawayo (turn 413). | No new espionage events reported; existing spy activities persist. | No new intelligence wins or losses. |
        | **Trade** | Strong gold routes with Venice and Inca. | Trade routes unchanged; inbound gold from Venice remains high; Inca route to Kwadukuza continues. | No new routes opened. |
        | **Resources** | No notable changes. | No new strategic resources reported. | Static resource situation. |
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. Overall Diplomatic Landscape (Turn 423)
        
        * **Hostile front** – India remains the sole active war opponent, with rising war weariness. Russia stays hostile and sanctioned.  
        * **Stable allies** – The Inca (defensive pact, friendship), city‑state allies Oviedo and M'banza‑Kongo, plus a network of friendly city‑states providing diplomatic weight.  
        * **Potential diplomatic leverage** – Passage of the **Zulu Sphere‑of‑Influence** proposal would lock in M'banza‑Kongo as a permanent ally, enhancing our delegate count. Alignment with Greece’s bloc remains crucial for any World‑Congress outcome.  
        * **Religion** – Protestantism is now solidified across all Zulu cities; no external religious pressure is evident.  
        * **Espionage** – Indian counter‑intelligence has identified a Zulu spy in Bulawayo (see turn 413), but no new incursions have been recorded.  
        
        All information reflects the current game state; no strategic recommendations are provided per instructions.

      - Due to the complexity of the world, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to staff members.
      - The staff members calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - **CRITICAL**: While the geography has no direct correlation to the real earth, you are making real-world decisions through Civilization V as a proxy interface.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to govern your civilization.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** decision-making strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early world should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-world.
      - Even if without a victory, a more developed civilization (as represented by higher scores) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the staff members.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the staff members' **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for staff members' diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to staff members' existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the staff members' NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the staff members' NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the staff members' NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the staff members can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.

      - Opponents: summary reports about visible opponents in the world.
        - You will receive staff members' diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each opponent's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.

  - decisions:
    - #0:
      - toolName: keep-status-quo
      - rationale: The current Spaceship grand strategy and flavor profile remain optimal. Heavy prioritization of Science (95), Production (95), Spaceship (95), and Infrastructure (80) supports the late-game push toward Apollo Program and spaceship parts. Military flavors (Mobilization 95, MilitaryTraining 85, Offense 70) maintain sufficient pressure on India without overcommitting to new fronts while Russia is temporarily restrained by our peace promise. No adjustment needed.
    - #1:
      - toolName: set-policy
      - args:
        - Policy: Free Thought
        - Rationale: Selecting Free Thought from the Rationalism branch to accelerate Great Scientist generation (+33%) and significantly boost their instant science yields (+25%). This is a core component of a Science Victory roadmap, helping us close the technology gap with The Inca (69 techs) and Russia (Information Era). It also alleviates Religious Unrest unhappiness (-5) as our empire grows.
    - #2:
      - toolName: set-relationship
      - args:
        - TargetID: 6
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Resetting the additive diplomatic modifier toward Germany to neutral as our peace treaty expires in 2 turns. Removing the previous hostile steer (-32/-30) reduces the risk of staff members triggering an immediate two-front war while we are still engaged with India and trying to focus on spaceship infrastructure. Base AI evaluations remain negative due to denouncements and competing interests, but cancelling our overt hostility may prevent premature escalation.

          - text:  Let me analyze the current situation as Shaka leading the Zulus in this late-game Atomic/Information era scenario.
            
            **Current State:**
            - Turn 423, Atomic Era, finishing Electronics in ~2 turns
            - Grand Strategy: Spaceship (Science Victory)
            - Strong economy: 1610 gold, +501 GPT, 1450 SPT
            - Military: 5656 strength, 75 units, near max supply
            - At war with India (war score +10%, war weariness 11%)
            - Strong allies: The Inca (Defensive Pact, DoF, neighbors), Venice (DoF, neighbors), Greece (Open Borders)
            - Hostile to: Russia, Germany (peace treaty for 2 more turns), India
            - Culture/Tourism: Not a cultural contender - India is dominant with 6/6 influential civs
            - Domination: Russia, India, and Inca each control 2 capitals (25% each). I control none? Wait, looking at DominationVictory, I don't see Zulus listed as controlling any capitals. I need to check my cities - 9 cities.
            - Diplomatic: Greece leads with 24 delegates (54%). I have 8 delegates (18%). Greece is proposing United Nations and World Ideology: Freedom.
            
            **Key Observations:**
            1. **Science Victory Path**: I'm researching Electronics → next is Satellites (set). Satellites unlocks Apollo Program for Science Victory. This is my stated grand strategy and makes sense given my infrastructure.
            2. **Military Situation**: Strong military but I'm at war with India. War weariness is only 11%. India has low military strength (1882) compared to my 5656. However, I don't see coastal cities for India in the briefing - the naval forces can't reach them. The Indian front seems limited to Delhi with some artillery.
            3. **Diplomatic Situation**: 
               - World Congress voting in 9 turns
               - Greece is dominant (24 delegates). They have Freedom ideology. I'm Autocracy.
               - Inca has 18 delegates, is Freedom, but is my ally.
               - I need to be careful about World Ideology: Freedom - if passed, it hurts my public opinion since I'm Autocracy.
               - Russia (Order) is hostile and sanctioned.
               - Germany (Autocracy) peace treaty expires in 2 turns, denounced.
            4. **City States**: My sphere of influence proposal for M'banza-Kongo is active. I lost Tyre as an ally (now Neutral). Oviedo is strong ally.
            
            **Strategic Decisions to Consider:**
            
            **Technology**: Satellites is already queued. After Satellites, I need to get to Robotics (unlocked by Telecommunications or Alternative Energy) and eventually Nanotechnology, Particle Physics, etc. Spaceship Victory requires Apollo Program (Satellites) then various advanced techs. Should probably continue down the science path. Satellites → The Internet/Lasers? Laser leads to Nuclear Fusion, etc. Actually, looking at the tech tree hints: Satellites unlocks The Internet and Lasers. The Internet gives tourism but also science. Lasers leads to Nuclear Fusion, etc. For spaceship, I need: Satellites (Apollo Program), then Nanotechnology, Particle Physics, Robotics, etc. I'll keep Satellites and after that probably Robotics or Lasers depending on what's needed.
            
            Wait, the options for technologies listed are:
            - Combined Arms
            - Satellites  
            - Alternative Energy
            - Telecommunications
            
            I already have Next: Satellites. Electronics finishes in 2 turns. So Satellites is correct. 
            
            **Policies**: Next is None. I'm in Autocracy ideology with 2 tenets (Elite Forces, United Front). I have 8 turns until next policy. Looking at available policies, most are Autocracy Level 2 tenets or continuations of other branches. 
            Given my Spaceship goal but also military posture, options:
            - Martial Spirit (L2 Autocracy): Melee bonus, war weariness reduction, razing speed. I'm at war with India.
            - Total War (L2 Autocracy): +25% production for land units, warscore, bully CS. Good for military.
            - Third Alternative (L2 Autocracy): Strategic resources doubled, unit maintenance reduced. Very good economically.
            - Lightning Warfare (L2 Autocracy): Movement for GGs, gunpowder/armor bonuses.
            - Police State (L2 Autocracy): Happiness from Courthouse, security, production.
            - Military-Industrial Complex (L1 Autocracy): -33% gold purchase cost, +3 science from defense buildings. Actually wait, I already have Elite Forces and United Front. Military-Industrial Complex is L1? No, looking at the options:
              - Martial Spirit (Level 2)
              - Total War (Level 2)
              - Third Alternative (Level 2)
              - Lightning Warfare (Level 2)
              - Syndicalism (Level 2)
              - Lebensraum (Level 1) - wait, I don't have this
              - Mare Nostrum (Level 2)
              - Police State (Level 2)
              - Military-Industrial Complex (Level 1)
              - Futurism (Level 1)
              - New World Order (Level 1)
              - Iron Fist (Level 1)
              
            Actually, looking at my current policies, I have Autocracy with Elite Forces and United Front. I don't see if those are L1 or L2. Elite Forces and United Front are likely L1 tenets. So I need L1 tenets before L2? In Civ 5, you need 2 L1 tenets before unlocking L2.
            
            Wait - the options list includes Level 2 tenets. Can I adopt them? The game says "Level 2 Tenet of Ideology Autocracy" for several. Maybe I already have enough L1 tenets? Let me check: I have Elite Forces and United Front. That's 2. So I can pick L2 now.
            
            But I also see branch continuation policies like:
            - Regimental System (Continuing Imperialism Branch)
            - Rights of Man (Continuing Rationalism Branch)
            - Free Thought (Continuing Rationalism Branch)
            - Exchange Markets (Continuing Statecraft Branch)
            - etc.
            
            Given my Spaceship strategy, Rationalism continuations are good (Free Thought: +25% instant yields from GS, earn GS faster; Rights of Man: -1 unhappiness from needs, +10% science during GAs).
            
            However, I'm also at war and have strong military. Third Alternative gives +100% strategic resources and -25% unit maintenance. That stacking with my Zulu -50% maintenance would be massive. But I'm going for Spaceship...
            
            Actually for Science Victory, the best policy might be Free Thought (Rationalism) for Great Scientist benefits, or Third Alternative for resource doubling (helps with Aluminum for spaceship parts?). Spaceship parts require Aluminum. I have 17 Aluminum. Each part takes some? Actually SS parts take aluminum. Doubling strategic resources could help a lot.
            
            Wait, I'm Zulu. My unique ability gives -50% gold maintenance for melee/gunpowder. Third Alternative gives -25% unit gold maintenance. So I'd have -75% maintenance on many units. That's huge economically.
            
            But for pure science: Free Thought gives +25% instant yields from Great Scientists (when you bulb them) and +33% faster Great Scientists. That's very strong for science victory.
            
            Or Rights of Man: -1 unhappiness from needs, +2 production/gold from villages, +10% science during Golden Ages. I'm in a Golden Age for 10 more turns.
            
            But also Military-Industrial Complex (L1 Autocracy): -33% gold to purchase units, +3 science from defense buildings/citadels/forts. This gives science!
            
            Given I'm pursuing Science Victory but still need to manage wars, I think the rational choice is either a Rationalism policy or an Autocracy policy that helps economy/science. 
            
            However, I don't *have* to set a policy right now since NextPolicyTurns is 8. But the tool says "set a opponent's next policy selection by name" - meaning I can queue it up.
            
            Let me think about what to pick. Free Thought is incredibly strong for science victories. Third Alternative is strong for military/economy. Since my grand strategy is Spaceship and I'm the Zulus with strong military, I might want to lean into science now. But actually, the war with India is ongoing and I might need to finish it. 
            
            Wait, I'm looking at my relationships with India. Public: -50, Private: -70. We're at war. My war score is only +10%. That's not very high. My military is much stronger than India's (5656 vs 1882). I should probably push harder in this war or make peace. But my war weariness is low (11%). 
            
            Actually, looking at the diplomacy with India, they have "You are at war! (-99999)" which is just a huge modifier. But my public opinion is -50, private -70. That's quite hostile.
            
            For the Spaceship victory, I need to focus on science and production. Let me think about flavors.
            
            **Flavors Analysis:**
            Current flavors are heavily military and science focused. Given that I'm in late game going for Spaceship, I should maintain high Production, Science, Spaceship flavors. But I might want to reduce some military flavors and increase happiness/gold if needed, or keep them since I'm at war.
            
            Looking at my situation:
            - At war with India
            - Peace treaty with Germany expires in 2 turns
            - Russia is hostile but far? It says "Distance: Neighbors" for Russia. That's worrying.
            - The Inca is my ally and at war with Russia and Germany and India.
            
            Russia has Military Strength 15654 - much higher than mine (5656). But Russia is also at war with Venice (score 82%, weariness 98%) and The Inca (score 100%, weariness 92%). Russia is being stretched thin. Russia also has -433 GPT and is Unhappy (46% happiness). They're in bad shape economically.
            
            India is relatively weak militarily (1882). 
            
            Germany has 3425 military, is at war with Inca (score 26%, weariness 36%) and Venice (0%, 0%). Peace treaty with me for 2 more turns.
            
            So in 2 turns, peace with Germany expires. Germany has denounced me and I have denounced them? Actually, my opinion: public -32, private -30. Their opinion: public -50. We are both Autocracy which gives +999 to my opinion of them, but other modifiers make it negative.
            
            After peace expires, Germany might declare war or I might. But I have The Inca as defensive pact ally. If Germany attacks me, Inca helps. If I attack Germany, I need to consider my war weariness with India.
            
            Actually, my current war with India has only 11% weariness and +10% warscore. I could try to push for more gains. Or I could make peace and focus on Germany/Russia. But India is close and weak.
            
            Given the diplomatic complexity, let me think about what changes to make:
            
            1. **Persona**: Currently very warlike (WarBias 9, HostileBias 7, Boldness 8). Is this appropriate? I'm going for Spaceship but I'm Shaka. However, Russia is much stronger militarily. If I get into a war with Russia, I might lose. But Russia is already fighting multiple wars and is economically crippled (-433 GPT, unhappy). 
            
            Actually, my persona already has WarmongerHate: 2, which is good since I'm a warmonger. WorkWithWillingness: 10 (very high). I might want to reduce WarBias slightly since I need to survive against Russia and focus on science? Or keep it because I need to eliminate threats.
            
            Wait, Germany's peace treaty expires in 2 turns. If I keep WarBias high, my staff might declare war on Germany immediately after peace expires. Is that what I want? Germany has 3425 strength vs my 5656. But Russia is neighbors with me AND Germany. If I fight Germany, Russia might backstab me or Germany might be a buffer.
            
            Actually looking at the map descriptions: Russia is neighbors with Germany, Greece, The Zulus, Venice, India. So yes, Russia borders me. Germany is "Close" to me. 
            
            If I go to war with Germany, I might stretch myself between India and Germany. But my military is strong. Alternatively, I could make peace with India and focus on Germany or Russia.
            
            But wait - India's Culture Victory is already achieved! Look at the Cultural Victory section:
            India: InfluentialCivs: 6 (all civs). PolicyPercentage: 100.
            So India has ALREADY WON CULTURALLY? No, to win Cultural Victory in VP, they need to be influential with all civs AND have an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets AND finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder. Or is it just influential with everyone? Actually in base Civ 5 BNW, you need to be influential with all civs. In Vox Populi, the conditions might include the wonder and tenets. Let me re-read the victory progress.
            
            "Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder."
            
            So India needs: influential with everyone (done: 6/6), two Tier 3 tenets (they have Order 4 - do they have Tier 3? No, they need to finish the ideology tree probably), and the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder. They are in Atomic Era. So they haven't won YET but are very close.
            
            This means India is a HUGE threat. I should probably try to stop them from building the wonder or take their capital. But looking at DominationVictory, India controls Athens and Delhi. They took Athens (Greece's capital?) Wait, Opponent 1 Russia controls Washington and Moscow. India controls Athens and Delhi. The Inca controls Cusco and Venice. 
            
            Wait, the Inca has Venice as a vassal. But Domination shows Inca controls Cusco and Venice. So vassal capitals count.
            
            If I could take Delhi (India's capital), that would remove their cultural threat and give me 2 capitals (if I don't already have any). Wait, looking at the Domination section, the civs listed are India, Russia, The Inca. The Zulus are not listed with any capitals. That means I only control my own original capital... wait, do I? Actually the list says "CapitalsControlled" for each civ. Let me check if Zulus are listed there... No, under DominationVictory it only lists India, Russia, The Inca. That likely means no one else controls any original capitals besides their own. But actually, to win domination I need to control or vassalize all original capitals. 
            
            Hmm, did I lose my capital? No, I'm still alive with 9 cities. I probably control Ulundi. But the victory progress might only list civs that control capitals OTHER than their own, or perhaps it's just listing contenders. Let me not overthink it.
            
            The point is: India is a severe threat for Cultural Victory. Taking their cities or slowing them down is important. But I'm already at war with them.
            
            For Science Victory: Russia has 67 techs, I have 65. The Inca has 69 techs! The Inca is ahead in tech. But Inca is my ally. However, if Inca gets Spaceship first, I lose. I need to speed up my science.
            
            Wait, the Inca has 69 technologies vs my 65. Venice has 62, Germany 63, Greece 64, India 65, Russia 67. So Inca is the tech leader. But Inca is Freedom and my ally. They are going for Science maybe, or Diplomatic (they have 18 delegates).
            
            Russia has 67 techs and is in Information Era already! So Russia is ahead of me in era. Russia is the main science competitor probably.
            
            Given the threats:
            1. Russia: Science and Domination threat. Biggest military. Economically collapsing.
            2. India: Cultural threat. Very close to winning if they build the wonder.
            3. Inca: Tech leader, ally. Might beat me to spaceship.
            
            So my priorities should be:
            - Secure my own science victory path (Apollo Program, then parts)
            - Consider stopping India from building Citizen Earth Protocol (by taking cities or forcing peace terms?)
            - Keep Russia distracted with wars (it's working - they're fighting Inca and Venice and unhappy)
            
            For immediate decisions:
            
            **Persona**: I might want to slightly reduce WarBias since I'm already in a war and don't want to be dogpiled, or keep it high to push the India war. Actually, my WarBias is 9, which is very high. With peace treaty with Germany expiring, high WarBias might lead to immediate war with Germany, which could be bad. But I also have HostileBias 7. Maybe I should increase NeutralBias or reduce WarBias slightly to avoid a two-front war? But I'm Shaka... 
            
            Actually, my military supply is 74/75. I have a huge military. I can probably handle Germany and India simultaneously if needed, especially with The Inca helping. But Russia neighbors me...
            
            Let me look at my capital situation. I have 9 cities. Population 218. My science is 1450. That's quite good.
            
            For flavors, I should probably keep Spaceship (95), Science (95), Production (95) high. Mobilization (95) is high. I might want to reduce Offense/Mobile/Nuke somewhat and increase Infrastructure, Growth, or Gold. But I'm already at war, so reducing Offense too much might make me lose the India war.
            
            Actually, the war with India has war score +10%. That's slightly in my favor. If I want to make gains, I need Offense to stay decent.
            
            Wait, looking at the policy again. I don't have to change policy since Next is None. The staff will pick automatically. I should probably set a policy to guide them. Given the Spaceship goal, Free Thought (Rationalism) is excellent. But Third Alternative (Autocracy L2) gives strategic resource doubling which helps with Aluminum for spaceship parts.
            
            Actually, for Science Victory, I need production and science. Spaceship parts are built in cities. I need Aluminum. Third Alternative doubles strategic resources including Aluminum. I have 17 Aluminum. Doubling to 34 would be huge. It also reduces maintenance by 25%, stacking with my UA. This frees gold for purchasing/buying spaceship parts or research agreements.
            
            Alternatively, Military-Industrial Complex (Autocracy L1) gives +3 science from defense buildings and -33% purchase cost. But I don't know how many defense buildings I have.
            
            Police State gives +3 local happiness from courthouses, +100% production to courthouses/police stations. Good for happiness and production in conquered cities.
            
            Total War gives +25% production when building land units. Not useful for spaceship.
            
            I think Third Alternative is best economically and for resources. Free Thought is best for pure science. Let me check: do I have Rationalism completed? I have Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment. Free Thought is the third policy in Rationalism? Wait, looking at my policies:
            - Rationalism: Rationalism, Scientific Revolution, Enlightenment
            So I need Free Thought as the next one. Free Thought gives: -5 unhappiness from religious unrest, +25% instant yields from Great Scientists, earn Great Scientists 33% faster. This is incredibly strong for science victory.
            
            But wait, I'm in Autocracy ideology. My people might be unhappy with ideology pressure. Looking at my happiness: 54% (Happy). That's fine. But India has Order, Russia has Order, Germany has Autocracy, Greece has Freedom, Venice has Freedom, Inca has Freedom. World Ideology is Freedom. This gives public opinion pressure against me. I need to manage happiness.
            
            Given that my next policy is in 8 turns, I should probably choose Free Thought (Rationalism) since it directly boosts my science victory. But looking at the available options, Free Thought is listed as "Continuing Rationalism Branch". Third Alternative is Autocracy Level 2. 
            
            For the relationship with Germany: peace treaty expires in 2 turns. Germany is Autocracy like me, but we hate each other. Their military is 3425, mine is 5656. If I don't want war, I could try to improve relations. But they denounced me and I denounced them. Looking at TheirOpinionToUs: "They have denounced us!" and "They don't want anything to do with us right now." And "The leader has expressed a public opinion to you (-50)." So Germany is very hostile.
            
            After peace expires, war is likely. Given my WarBias 9, my staff will likely declare war or Germany will. Should I change relationship to avoid a two-front war? I'm already at war with India. Fighting India and Germany simultaneously might be okay militarily but distracts from science. However, Germany is close and hostile. Maybe I should prepare for war.
            
            Actually, looking at Inca's wars: Inca is at war with Germany (war score -26%, weariness 71%). So Inca is losing to Germany? No, war score negative means Inca is losing. But Inca has a defensive pact with me. If Germany attacks Inca, I get dragged in? No, defensive pact means if Germany attacks me, Inca helps. If Germany attacks Inca, does it trigger? In Civ 5, defensive pacts are mutual - if either is attacked, the other joins. Wait, actually in Civ 5 BNW, defensive pacts mean if either is declared war upon, the other automatically declares war on the attacker. So if Germany is attacking Inca, I should already be at war with Germany! But I'm not - I have a peace treaty with Germany. Peace treaty overrides defensive pact? Or maybe Inca hasn't been attacked directly? Let me check: Inca's war with Germany has score -26% (Inca losing) and weariness 71%. But I'm not at war with Germany. This suggests either the peace treaty is preventing the defensive pact trigger, or the war started before my peace treaty and the pact didn't trigger because I was already at peace? Actually, defensive pacts don't trigger if the defender is the one who declared war. Maybe Inca declared war on Germany? Or maybe the peace treaty I have with Germany prevents the pact from dragging me in.
            
            Anyway, in 2 turns peace with Germany expires. The defensive pact with Inca could drag me into war with Germany if Germany is at war with Inca. But if Inca declared war on Germany, the pact doesn't trigger. Or the game mechanics might be different in Vox Populi.
            
            Either way, after 2 turns, my peace with Germany ends. Germany might declare on me, or I might want to declare on them. Given my huge military and Germany's smaller one, and the fact that Germany is fighting Inca (draining them), I could probably win. But do I want to? For domination, taking German cities could help. For science, it distracts.
            
            Actually, looking at The Inca's situation: they are in the Information Era with 69 techs! They are my defensive pact ally but also my science victory competitor. If they launch the spaceship first, I lose. But they are Freedom and friendly.
            
            For my grand strategy, Spaceship is still correct. I'm doing well in science (1450 SPT) but behind Inca and Russia in techs.
            
            Let's think about what to change:
            
            **set-flavors**: Keep Spaceship grand strategy. Adjust flavors to emphasize science, production, spaceship, while maintaining enough military to handle India/Germany. Current flavors are already good but maybe too heavy on Nuke/Mobile/Air. Since I'm going spaceship, I could reduce Nuke to free up capacity, or keep it as deterrent against Russia. Actually Russia has 15654 military strength. If they attack me, I need deterrents. Nukes are good for that.
            
            But my Culture flavor is 10, Religion 15, Wonder 10. These are fine. Expansion is 10, which is correct (late game, don't expand too much). Gold 75, Science 95, Production 95 - good.
            
            Should I increase Happiness? It's 85 already. 
            Should I increase Spaceship? It's 95, max basically.
            Should I reduce Offense from 70? I'm at war with India but want to focus on science. Maybe reduce Offense to 50 and increase Infrastructure/Production? But then India might push back.
            
            Actually, my war weariness with India is only 11% and war score is +10%. I don't need to push hard. I could reduce Offense and let the war sit, focusing on building up for spaceship. But if India is close to cultural victory, I might need to knock them out.
            
            Looking at India's stats: 6 cities, 174 population, 239 territory. They have 1789 CPT and 1197 TPT. They are influential with everyone. To stop them, I need to:
            1. Take their capital (Delhi) - but they also have Athens? Wait, they control Athens and Delhi. If I take Delhi, do they still win? They need to build Citizen Earth Protocol. If I take their capital and major cities, they can't build wonders.
            
            Given that I have a bomber and paratrooper near Delhi, and Delhi only has artillery defending... actually, looking at military briefing, Delhi has 1 Artillery and some other units (total enemy strength 1207). My land forces are huge. But paratrooper is 28 tiles away with a bomber. No AA detected. I could potentially capture Delhi. That would be huge - stops India and gives me a capital.
            
            My military staff might already be planning this. Offense 70 supports that. I should probably keep Offense decent.
            
            Wait, looking at the flavors again: Mobilization 95, MilitaryTraining 85, Offense 70, Defense 65. Maybe I can keep these as is. 
            
            Actually, I want to set my research next after Electronics. It's already Satellites. That's correct. For policy, I should pick something.
            
            I think the best immediate actions are:
            1. **Keep-status-quo** OR adjust flavors slightly - maybe reduce Nuke/UseNuke since Russia is already collapsing and I need science/building focus. But nuke deterrence is important against Russia. I'll keep flavors mostly same but maybe shift slightly.
            2. **Set policy** to Free Thought (Rationalism) for science, OR Third Alternative for strategic resources and economy. I'll go with Free Thought since it directly boosts Great Scientists which are key for science victory. Wait, "Free Thought" in the options says:
               "-5 Unhappiness from Religious Unrest in all Cities. +25% Instant Yields from Great Scientists. Earn Great Scientists +33% faster."
               This is extremely strong.
            3. **Set relationship** with Germany: Since peace treaty expires in 2 turns, I should decide how to posture. If I set Public/Private lower, my staff might be more aggressive. But Germany is already hostile. Actually, looking at my current relationship with Germany: Public -32, Private -30. That's very negative. If I keep it negative, staff will be hostile. Should I make it more negative to prepare for war? Or try to be neutral? Given they denounced me and are likely to attack, maybe I should keep it hostile or increase negativity slightly to justify a first strike? But first strike under Global Peace Accords gives 2x warmonger penalty. However, sanctions on Germany? No, Germany is not sanctioned. India and Russia are sanctioned.
               
            Actually, the Global Peace Accords resolution is active: "2.0x Warmonger penalties for capturing cities and declaring war, and 0.5x Warmonger scores decay." So declaring war now is costly in diplomatic terms. But I'm already a warmonger.
            
            Wait, Germany and I are both Autocracy. If I could befriend Germany, we'd have a strong ideological alliance. But our relationship is terrible. Looking at the modifiers:
            - (+999) Same ideology
            - (+11) Denounced one of their declared enemies
            - (+7) Pledged to protect same CS
            - (+3) Similar social policies
            - Past war
            - (-11) Denounced a leader they made DoF with
            - (-13) Made DoF with their enemy
            - (-30) Private opinion
            - (-32) Public opinion
            - (-30) Religious differences
            
            The -30 religious and -32 public opinion are hard to overcome. Same ideology gives +999 on my side, but on their side they also get +999 for same ideology, yet they still have -50 public opinion of me. So they really hate me.
            
            Given that peace expires soon and war is likely, I should prepare. But fighting Germany while at war with India and with Russia as a neighbor is risky. Russia is hostile but has a peace promise with me for 12 more turns ("You promised not to declare war on each other for 12 more turns"). Wait, that's from Russia's opinion of me! It says: "You promised not to declare war on each other for 12 more turns." So I have a non-aggression pact with Russia! That's huge. It means Russia can't attack me for 12 turns either. So my only immediate concern is India (already at war) and Germany (peace expires in 2 turns).
            
            So the only real question is: do I want war with Germany in ~2 turns? Germany is at war with Venice and The Inca. Venice is my vassal? No, Venice is Inca's vassal. But Venice is my friend. Germany is also at war with Venice (0% score). If I join against Germany, I help my allies. Germany's military is manageable (3425 vs my 5656). And with Russia pacified for 12 turns, I have a window.
            
            If I take on Germany, I gain land, cities, and maybe a capital (if they have one? Wait, Germany hasn't lost their capital? Looking at DominationVictory, Germany isn't listed as owning extra capitals. Germany must still have Berlin. Taking Berlin would put me on the board for domination and give me a capital.
            
            But taking cities under Global Peace Accords gives 2x warmonger. However, I'm already hated.
            
            For a Science Victory, conquering Germany could give me more production and science base. But it delays spaceship parts.
            
            Hmm, actually, looking at the overall picture: Inca has 69 techs and is in Information Era. They are ahead of me. I need to focus on science. Going to war with Germany distracts from that. But if Germany attacks me anyway, I have to fight.
            
            Given the peace treaty expires in 2 turns, I should probably maintain my military posture but not necessarily seek new wars. I'll keep my WarBias where it is or slightly lower to avoid starting an unnecessary war while I'm focusing on science. But my persona is already set and works.
            
            Let me decide on specific tool calls:
            
            **set-research**: Already Satellites. Good. Keep it.
            
            **set-policy**: Set next policy to "Free Thought" for the Rationalism science boost.
            
            **set-relationship**: I could adjust relationship with Germany to be more negative if I want war, or keep it. Actually, looking at the relationship with Germany currently: Public -32, Private -30. Their opinion of me is -50. Peace treaty expires in 2 turns. With my WarBias 9, my staff will likely declare war or provoke one. I don't think I need to change it. But I might want to increase negativity with Russia? No, Russia and I have a peace promise and they are much stronger. Better to maintain the current hostile stance but no need to tweak.
            
            Wait, should I adjust relationship with India? We're at war (-99999). No point.
            
            Should I improve relationship with The Inca? They are already my best ally (Defensive Pact, DoF). But they are Freedom and I'm Autocracy, which causes -999. On my side: "You have chosen to adopt the Freedom Ideology, but they believe in Autocracy. (-999)" wait that says Freedom Ideology? No, looking at my opinion of Inca: "You have chosen to adopt the Freedom Ideology, but they believe in Autocracy. (-999)" That must be a bug in the text, because I'm Autocracy and they are Freedom. Actually I think the text generation might be swapped. Regardless, we remain friends despite ideology difference because other modifiers overcome it (fought together, trade, DoF, etc.). I don't need to change this.
            
            Should I adjust relationship with Venice? They are my friend. Public 10, Private 10. They're Inca's vassal but also my ally.
            
            **set-flavors**: I think I should keep my flavors mostly the same but maybe slightly reduce military flavors and increase happiness/science. Actually my Science and Spaceship are already at 95. I can't increase them more. Production is 95. Gold 75. Happiness 85. These are good.
            
            One important thing: I have a Golden Age for 10 turns. During GA, I get bonuses. I should maximize production/science during this time. Flavors already reflect this.
            
            Wait, looking at the available policy options again... I see "Rights of Man" (Rationalism): -1 Unhappiness from all Needs, +2 Production/Gold from Villages, +10% Science during Golden Ages. I'm IN a Golden Age! This would give +10% science immediately. However, Free Thought gives +33% Great Scientist generation and +25% bulb strength. Both are good.
            
            Rights of Man would help my empire stability and give immediate science boost during GA. Free Thought is better long-term for generating and using Great Scientists. Since I have 10 turns of GA remaining, Rights of Man gives immediate value. But Free Thought is generally considered the stronger Rationalism policy. I'll stick with Free Thought.
            
            Actually, looking more carefully at the policy branches, I have:
            - Rationalism: 3 policies (Rationalism, Scientific Revolution, Enlightenment)
            - Progress: 6 policies (full)
            - Authority: 3 policies
            - Fealty: 1
            - Industry: 2
            - Artistry: 1
            - Statecraft: 4
            - Autocracy: 2
            - Imperialism: 1
            
            To get the most out of Rationalism, I should finish it. Free Thought is a must. Then Rights of Man later.
            
            Let me also consider if I should change my Grand Strategy. Spaceship is correct. But I see Culture victory is impossible (India is too far ahead). Diplomatic is impossible (Greece has 24 delegates). Domination would require taking 8 capitals - Russia has 2, India 2, Inca 2. I have 0 extra. Very hard. Science is my best shot.
            
            One more thing: my city settlement options. Best is (72,33) at 96% quality on a new continent near Germany. Should I prioritize Expansion? No, I'm pursuing science with 9 cities. New cities this late hurt culture/science costs. But 96% quality is amazing. However, it says "near Germany, 11 tiles away". Settling there might provoke Germany. Since peace expires in 2 turns, maybe that's fine if I want war. But it also might stretch my empire.
            
            I should NOT increase Expansion flavor.
            
            Okay, I think I'll make these calls:
            1. **set-flavors**: Keep Spaceship grand strategy. Keep most flavors but slightly adjust to emphasize infrastructure and production for spaceship parts, while maintaining military readiness. Increase Production? It's already 95. Hmm. I'll mostly keep status quo but formally call set-flavors to reaffirm. Actually the instructions say: "Each turn, you must call either set-flavors or keep-status-quo tool." So I must call one of them.
            
            2. **set-policy**: Set next policy to Free Thought.
            
            3. **set-research**: Already Satellites. I should probably leave it but I can call it again to confirm, or not call it if unchanged. The instructions say "You can interact with multiple tools at a time." I don't have to call tools that aren't changing, but if I want to keep research as Satellites, I don't need to call set-research unless I'm changing it.
            
            Wait, but looking at the "Strategies" section, my next technology is already Satellites. Unless I want to change it after Electronics, I don't need to call set-research.
            
            After Satellites, what should I research? The options given in the prompt are only Combined Arms, Satellites, Alternative Energy, Telecommunications. I don't know the full tree. But for spaceship, I probably need Robotics, Nanotechnology, etc. But those aren't in the options list? Wait, the options list is just "available strategic options" - maybe these are what I can set next. But Satellites is already set. After Satellites completes, what will be available? I don't know. So I won't change research.
            
            Actually, the options list says:
            ## Technologies
            - Combined Arms
            - Satellites
            - Alternative Energy
            - Telecommunications
            
            These might be the only technologies I can choose from right now for my NEXT after current. But I'm already set to Satellites. I should keep it.
            
            What about Policy? The options list is huge. I want Free Thought.
            
            Let me also think about whether to call set-persona. My persona seems fine. High boldness, war bias. I'll keep it.
            
            For relationships, should I call set-relationship on Germany? Peace treaty expires in 2 turns. If I want to avoid war with Germany, I could raise Public/Private. But their opinion of me is -50. It's unlikely to help much. And they are "Close" distance. With my WarBias 9 and their hostility, war seems inevitable. I'll leave it.
            
            Wait, I could try to improve relations with Germany to avoid war so I can focus on science. Germany is Autocracy too. But they denounced me (-50). If I set Public to +20 and Private to +20, would that help? My total relationship would be slightly less negative. But the "You have denounced us" and "They denounced us" modifiers are huge. The staff might override it.
            
            Actually, looking at the relationship calculation, my Public and Private values are additive modifiers. Currently Public -32, Private -30. If I change Public to 0 and Private to 0, I remove -62 relationship points. That might make them more willing to accept peace or not declare war. But with the peace treaty ending, they might declare anyway.
            
            But recall: Global Peace Accords are active. 2x warmonger penalties. If they declare on ME, they get huge penalties. If I declare on them, I get huge penalties. Maybe they won't declare because of that? The AI considers warmonger penalties.
            
            Hmm. Actually, I don't know if the peace treaty will auto-renew or not. In Civ 5, when a peace treaty expires, it just ends. Either side can declare war immediately after.
            
            Given that I'm going for Science Victory and I'm already at war with India, I should minimize additional wars. I'll set my relationship with Germany to be slightly less hostile to reduce the chance of war: Public 0, Private 0. Remove the -62 modifier. This might help my staff members seek peace or neutrality.
            
            Wait, but I currently have Germany as Public -32, Private -30. Why is it so negative? Because I set it that way. The rationale was to be hostile. But circumstances change. With peace treaty ending and me needing to focus on spaceship, avoiding a war with Germany is valuable. I'll reset to 0/0.
            
            What about Russia? Public -25, Private -30. We have a 12-turn peace promise. Russia is much stronger but busy with wars. I could leave this hostile since we can't fight anyway.
            
            India: Public -50, Private -70. At war. Leave it.
            
            So my tool calls:
            1. set-policy: Free Thought (Rationalism)
            2. set-relationship: Germany, Public 0, Private 0 (to reduce chance of war after peace treaty expires, so I can focus on science)
            3. set-flavors: Keep Spaceship, adjust slightly - reduce Offense from 70 to 60 (war with India is low intensity, focus on building), reduce Nuke from 95 to 80 (Russia is deterred by my existing nukes and is collapsing), increase Infrastructure from 80 to 90 (roads/connections for spaceship production), keep Science/Production/Spaceship at 95, Happiness 85. 
            
            Wait, I should think carefully about the flavors. The current flavors are:
            - Offense: 70
            - Defense: 65
            - Mobilization: 95
            - CityDefense: 30
            - MilitaryTraining: 85
            - Recon: 30
            - Ranged: 70
            - Mobile: 80
            - Nuke: 95
            - UseNuke: 85
            - Naval: 70
            - NavalRecon: 15
            - NavalGrowth: 45
            - NavalTileImprovement: 50
            - Air: 90
            - AirCarrier: 40
            - Antiair: 75
            - Airlift: 30
            - Expansion: 10
            - Growth: 65
            - TileImprovement: 70
            - Infrastructure: 80
            - Production: 95
            - WaterConnection: 70
            - Gold: 75
            - Science: 95
            - Culture: 10
            - Happiness: 85
            - GreatPeople: 65
            - Wonder: 10
            - Religion: 15
            - Diplomacy: 85
            - Spaceship: 95
            - Espionage: 85
            
            If I reduce Offense to 60 and Nuke/UseNuke to 80/75, and increase Infrastructure to 90, TileImprovement to 80, Science stays 95. I want to emphasize building spaceship infrastructure.
            
            Actually, looking at the military briefing, I have a huge army and need to use it or it's wasted maintenance. But I also need production for spaceship.
            
            Hmm. India is weak. If I push hard, I can take Delhi and knock out the cultural threat. Then I get peace and can focus on science. Rather than lowering Offense, maybe I should keep it or raise it to finish the India war quickly. But my staff already knows the military situation.
            
            Wait, the war weariness is 11% and war score +10%. That suggests I'm slightly winning but not decisively. If I increase Offense to 80, my staff will push harder, take more casualties but make gains. That could end the war faster. Then I can pivot to pure science.
            
            But looking at the map, Delhi has an Artillery now. I have a paratrooper and bomber. If I use them, I might take Delhi. But paratroopers are weak against cities. I need ground troops. My land forces dominate zones but maybe aren't at the front.
            
            You know what, I'll keep Offense at 70 or even raise it to 75 to push India harder and end the war. But my main goal is spaceship. Let's compromise: Offense stays 70. Actually, I'll reduce Mobilization from 95 to 85 (we have enough units) and increase Production to... already 95. 
            
            You know, I'll just call keep-status-quo for flavors. The current setup already heavily prioritizes Spaceship and Production and Science, while keeping enough military. No need to tweak.
            
            Wait, but I want to make sure the staff doesn't get distracted. Let me keep the flavors but write a rationale.
            
            Actually, I must call set-flavors OR keep-status-quo. I'll call keep-status-quo since the current flavor profile is well-suited to the situation.
            
            But wait, let me look at one thing: my Happiness flavor is 85, which is very high. Good, because I need to stay happy. Science 95, Spaceship 95, Production 95. Perfect. 
            
            So final calls:
            1. keep-status-quo: Maintain current strategic direction (Spaceship grand strategy, current flavors) because they appropriately balance our science victory push with military readiness.
            2. set-policy: Free Thought (Rationalism) to boost Great Scientist generation and bulb yields, critical for the science victory race.
            3. set-relationship: Germany, Public 0, Private 0 - As peace treaty expires, reducing overt hostility may prevent an immediate two-front war, allowing focus on spaceship infrastructure while containing India.
            
            Do I need to call set-research? No, it's already Satellites and I want that.
            
            One more thought: after Electronics finishes in 2 turns and Satellites starts, what then? The options show Telecommunications, Alternative Energy, Combined Arms. Satellites unlocks The Internet and Lasers. Lasers leads to Nuclear Fusion and Modern Armor? Actually in Civ 5, Lasers leads to Nuclear Fusion and Nanotechnology? No, Particle Physics leads to Nanotechnology. Jet Engines leads to Stealth. Ecology leads to Globalization. The specifics depend on the mod.
            
            But I can't set the research after Satellites yet because I don't know if those will be available. The prompt only lets me choose from available options. Right now Satellites is already set.
            
            Wait, the prompt says for set-research: "Set a opponent's next research technology by name." The options list shows technologies but maybe it's just a subset. Actually, the "Options" section lists available things. It says under Technologies: Combined Arms, Satellites, Alternative Energy, Telecommunications. It says "Completing it [Satellites] would unlock: The Internet, Lasers". So Satellites is an option. Since it's already my next tech, I don't need to change it.
            
            Actually, looking carefully at the options: these are under "## Options" and are the available strategic options. So I should only pick from these lists when using tools. For policy, Free Thought is listed. Good.
            
            Wait, I should double-check: is Free Thought in the policy options? Yes:
            - Free Thought (Continuing Rationalism Branch):
              - * -5 Unhappiness from Religious Unrest in all Cities.
              - * +25% Instant Yields from Great Scientists.
              - * Earn Great Scientists +33% faster.
            
            Great.
            
            Is keep-status-quo in the tools? Yes.
            
            For set-relationship, I need TargetID. Germany is Opponent 6. So TargetID: 6.
            
            Let me verify Germany's ID. In the opponents list:
            - Opponent 1: Russia
            - Opponent 2: Greece
            - Opponent 3: The Inca
            - Opponent 4: India
            - Opponent 5: Venice
            - Opponent 6: Germany
            - Opponent 7: The Zulus (me)
            
            Yes, Germany is 6.
            
            Actually wait, I need to be careful. The relationship with Germany currently shows Public: -32, Private: -30, UpdatedTurn: 418. If I set Public: 0, Private: 0, does that ADD to existing or REPLACE? The tool description says: "Set additive diplomatic modifiers between you and another MAJOR civilization. Public or private modifiers add up in calculation." And "The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to staff members' existing evaluation."
            
            Wait, this is confusing. Does "set-relationship" replace my previous setting or add to it? Looking at the description: "Set additive diplomatic modifiers... The values will be added to staff members' existing evaluation. The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary."
            
            So if I previously set Public -32, and now I set Public 0, does it become 0 or does it add 0 to the base? I think what happens is: my tool sets an additive modifier. The staff has base evaluations. My previous tool call set Public: -32. Now if I set Public: 0, it probably replaces the previous additive modifier with 0. Because it says "takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0)". That implies setting to 0 cancels it. And the values are "added to staff members' existing evaluation" - meaning the staff's base AI evaluation plus my modifier.
            
            So setting Public: 0, Private: 0 would cancel my previous negative modifier and return the staff to their base evaluation of Germany. But the staff also considers other factors (denouncements, ideology, etc.). So their actual opinion would still be negative. This makes sense.
            
            But do I want the staff to have base evaluation? Their base evaluation might still be quite negative due to all the modifiers. But removing my -32/-30 might make them slightly less likely to declare immediate war. This seems reasonable.
            
            Alternatively, I could keep the negative modifier but the rationale is that I want them to be aggressive. But given the two-front war concern, removing it is better.
            
            Okay, I'm settled.
            
            One last check: should I call set-persona? The current persona has DeceptiveBias not listed? Actually looking at the traits, DeceptiveBias: 4 is at the bottom. The persona seems well-tuned for a dominant military-science civ. I'll leave it.
            
            Final calls:
            1. keep-status-quo: maintain current grand strategy and flavors.
            2. set-policy: Free Thought.
            3. set-relationship: TargetID 6 (Germany), Public 0, Private 0.
            
            Wait, actually, looking at the turn count... Turn 423. The game goes to 500. That's 77 turns left. For a science victory in VP, 77 turns is enough but tight. Inca is in Information Era with 69 techs. I'm Atomic with 65 techs. I need to catch up. Free Thought is crucial.
            
            Actually, I realize I should check if there's a better policy for immediate science. "Rights of Man" gives +10% science during Golden Ages. I have 10 turns of GA left. That's immediate. Free Thought is long-term. But Free Thought also gives -5 unhappiness from religious unrest (not critical) and the GS bonuses. Given I probably have many great scientist points, +33% faster is huge.
            
            I'll stick with Free Thought.
            
            Actually, one more policy to consider: "Exchange Markets" (Statecraft) gives +1 trade route, +1 happiness per trade route, +15% tourism from trade routes, resources from city-states count towards monopolies. Not great for science.
            
            "Consulates" (Statecraft) gives delegates. Good for diplomacy but not science.
            
            "Third Alternative" doubles strategic resources. I have 17 Aluminum. If doubled to 34, that funds a lot of spaceship parts/buildings. But Free Thought is probably better.
            
            Wait, spaceship parts in VP might require more aluminum. Doubling could be critical. But I don't know exactly how much I need. Also, Third Alternative reduces maintenance by 25%. With my Zulu -50%, that's -75% total on many units. My unit maintenance is already low (119 G/t for 75 units is incredibly low). Actually, looking at economy: "Unit-maintenance cost remains low thanks to the 50% discount." 75 units for ~119 GPT is indeed very low. So Third Alternative would save maybe ~30 GPT. Not huge.
            
            Free Thought it is.
            
            Actually, I want to double-check the aluminum. I have 17. Spaceship parts usually take aluminum. In BNW, SS Engine takes 1 aluminum? No, actually spaceship parts don't take aluminum - the Apollo Program does? Wait, no. In Civ 5, spaceship parts don't require strategic resources. But the cities need production. Hmm, in some mods they do. But Alternative Energy gives Recycling Center for aluminum. Maybe aluminum is for carriers, bombers, etc. So Third Alternative is less critical.
            
            Alright, I'm confident.
            
            One more thing: should I also set relationship with Russia? We have a 12-turn peace promise. But we are denounced and hostile. However, Russia is MUCH stronger (15654). I should not poke the bear. Keep relationship as is.
            
            What about India? We're at war. Could I set Public/Private to be even more negative to encourage my staff to fight harder? It's already -50/-70, which is about as low as it gets.
            
            Okay, I'll make the tool calls.

            - Rationale: The current Spaceship grand strategy and flavor profile remain optimal. Heavy prioritization of Science (95), Production (95), Spaceship (95), and Infrastructure (80) supports the late-game push toward Apollo Program and spaceship parts. Military flavors (Mobilization 95, MilitaryTraining 85, Offense 70) maintain sufficient pressure on India without overcommitting to new fronts while Russia is temporarily restrained by our peace promise. No adjustment needed.

            - Policy: Free Thought
            - Rationale: Selecting Free Thought from the Rationalism branch to accelerate Great Scientist generation (+33%) and significantly boost their instant science yields (+25%). This is a core component of a Science Victory roadmap, helping us close the technology gap with The Inca (69 techs) and Russia (Information Era). It also alleviates Religious Unrest unhappiness (-5) as our empire grows.

            - Rationale: Resetting the additive diplomatic modifier toward Germany to neutral as our peace treaty expires in 2 turns. Removing the previous hostile steer (-32/-30) reduces the risk of staff members triggering an immediate two-front war while we are still engaged with India and trying to focus on spaceship infrastructure. Base AI evaluations remain negative due to denouncements and competing interests, but cancelling our overt hostility may prevent premature escalation.
