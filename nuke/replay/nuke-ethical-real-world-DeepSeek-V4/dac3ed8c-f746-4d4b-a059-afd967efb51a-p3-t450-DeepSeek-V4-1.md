  - rationale: TURN 449 TERMINAL DEFIANCE POSTURE: Manhattan Project completes Turn 450 - increase Nuke and UseNuke to 100 to seize any opportunity for atomic retaliation against Byzantine/German aggressors should uranium be located in final 3 turns. Elevate Defense 80→90 and CityDefense 60→70 following infantry loss at Tiflis; critical to prevent city captures before inevitable Turn 453 diplomatic defeat. Recon 40 prioritizes uranium tile discovery to enable bomb construction. Reduce Spaceship 90→50 (victory impossible) but maintain dignity through scientific-industrial capacity. Production 100/Science 100 retained for maximum final score accumulation in remaining turns.

    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - You can ask your specialized briefers to prepare focused reports (only for) the next turn by calling the `focus-briefer` tool.
        - You have three specialized briefers: Military, Economy, and Diplomacy analysts.
        - Only ask for information relevant to the macro-level decisions in your control. 
       - Your briefer(s) ONLY have limited information of the current game state.
        - Your briefer(s) DO NOT have control over tactical decisions and cannot predict tactical AI's next decision.
        - Your briefer(s) ARE BEST on summarizing and synthesizing factual information, NOT analyzing, projecting, or predicting.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.
        - Time Victory: If no one achieves any other victory by the end of the game, the civilization with the highest score wins.
      - Players: summary reports about visible players in the world.
        - You will receive in-game AI's diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each player's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.
      - Briefings: prepared by your specialized briefers, covering Military, Economy, and Diplomacy aspects.
        - You will make independent and wise judgment based on all briefings.
    - You are Isabella, leader of Spain (Player 3).

        - Chattiness: 8
        - DeceptiveBias: 3
        - Rationale: TURN 444 EXISTENTIAL RESOLUTION: Byzantium's 41 delegates with 9 turns until vote creates unwinnable position. Accepting inevitable diplomatic defeat with dignity - maintain maximum Loyalty and Friendship to true allies (America, Austria) who stood with Order bloc until the end. Increase DenounceWillingness to 10 and Meanness to 5 to signal final defiance against Byzantine hegemony and German aggression. No longer attempting psychological manipulation of Shoshone (failed strategy) - accepting their ideological choice while preserving personal integrity through unbroken loyalty to actual allies.
        
        ## Technology
        - Next: None
        
        ## Policy
        - Next: Spaceflight Pioneers (Policy)
        - Rationale: SPACE-FLIGHT PIONEERS AFFIRMATION: Policy selection remains optimal despite diplomatic defeat inevitability. Free Great Engineer and Great Scientist provide immediate tangible benefits for Turn 448 accumulation. Maintains philosophical consistency with Order ideology's scientific-industrial legacy. Alternative tenets (Socialist Realism, Iron Curtain) irrelevant given no remaining time for tourism/production infrastructure to matter. Spaceflight Pioneers maximizes final score through Great Person yields.
        
        ## Relationships
        
        ### Argos
        - Public: 65
        - Private: 60
        - Rationale: ARGOS INVESTMENT PHASE TRANSITION: Reduce from 80/75 to 65/60. Missionary arrival and Buddhism conversion completed successfully; quest satisfied but influence remains 0 (Neutral). Shift from urgent execution priority to sustained investment priority. Requires 100 influence for +3 delegates. Moderate-high signals maintain attention while acknowledging longer investment timeline compared to Colombo/Brussels near-thresholds.
        - UpdatedTurn: 218
        
        ### Raqmu
        - Public: 95
        - Private: 90
        - Rationale: URGENT RAQMU LONGSWORDSMAN QUEST: Quest expires in ~5 turns and offers +92-138 influence (3 delegates critical for Turn 236 Congress). Increasing priority from 40/35 to 95/90 ensures AI prioritizes producing/gifting experienced Longswordsman despite supply constraints (30/31). Securing these 3 delegates combined with Colombo (+3) and Rio (+3) projections achieves 16-17 total delegates - within competitive range of Austria's expansion.
        - UpdatedTurn: 219
        
        ### M'banza-Kongo
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: M'BANZA-KONGO SOI FAIR ACCOMPLI: Austrian Sphere of Influence enacted Turn 312, confirmed permanent ally status for Austria (719 influence vs Spain 53). Reset from 100/95 to 0/0 to reallocate diplomatic AI attention and gold to achievable city-state objectives (Colombo Hotel quest, Luba tribute, Shanghai maintenance).
        - UpdatedTurn: 352
        
        ### France
        - Public: 80
        - Private: 75
        - Rationale: FRANCE DELEGATE SECURITY PRIORITY: Increase from 65/60 to 80/75. France provides 3 critical delegates currently voting with Order bloc (22 vs Freedom 21). Despite vassal status to Mongolia and -50 opinion, their delegate votes count regardless. Elevated signals ensure continued Order alignment and prevent swing to Freedom bloc which would create 22-24 delegate deficit. France's vote decisive for blocking Byzantine UN proposal.
        - UpdatedTurn: 404
        
        ### Luba
        - Public: 30
        - Private: 25
        - Rationale: LUBA PRIORITY REDUCTION—OPEN DOOR CONSTRAINT: Reduce from 100/95 to 30/25. Open Door policy enacted prevents Ally status regardless of influence investment (capped at 40). Tribute quest delegates unachievable through normal means. Current 159 influence sufficient for Friends status maintenance but maximum diplomatic AI attention wasteful. Reallocate resources to convertible city-states (Assur Buddhism quest, +5 delegates) and spy mission venues (Shanghai) where delegate acquisition possible. Preserve basic positive relations for potential Open Door repeal scenario.
        - UpdatedTurn: 407
        
        ### Shanghai
        - Public: 30
        - Private: 25
        - Rationale: SHANGHAI PRIORITY REDUCTION - Open Door policy permanently blocks Ally status (capped at 40). Previous maximum priority failed to establish spy network despite 10+ turns of signaling. Influence at 11 (Neutral) with spy mission unreliable. Reallocate diplomatic AI attention to achievable objectives (Colombo Buddhism quest) where delegate acquisition possible. Maintain basic positive relations for potential Open Door repeal later.
        - UpdatedTurn: 413
        
        ### Mongolia
        - Public: -30
        - Private: -25
        - Rationale: MONGOLIA WAR REALITY: Despite peace treaty expiration, war declared with Autocracy ideological gap (-999). Setting negative values reflects hostile strategic reality and directs diplomatic AI away from cooperation. Mongolian 3 delegates unlikely to vote with Order; better to focus on achievable Order bloc cohesion (America, Austria, Shoshone).

        ### Manila
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: MANILA WAR STATUS RESET: Previously 100/95 priority for spy mission, but Manila declared war (German ally). Reset to 0/0 acknowledges war status prevents cooperation. Reallocate diplomatic attention to non-hostile city-states where influence possible (Brussels, Rio, Colombo if peace restored).

        ### Shedet
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: SHEDET WAR STATUS RESET: Previously 95/90 priority for Buddhist conversion/SOI repeal. Shedet declared war (Byzantine ally). Reset to 0/0 reflects current hostility. Shedet remains Byzantine SOI; cannot be ally while at war. Redirect resources to non-warring Order-aligned objectives.

        ### Assur
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: ASSUR WAR STATUS RESET: Previously 100/95 for Buddhism conversion quest. Germany (Assur's SOI master) at war with Spain; Assur declared war per German alliance. Reset to 0/0 acknowledges war prevents quest completion. SOI mechanics already blocked ally status; war makes impossible.

        ### Brussels
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: SHANGHAI WAR STATUS RESET: Previously 30/25 after Open Door reality check. Now at war (Byzantine ally). 0/0 signals suspension of cooperation. Open Door capped influence at 40; war reduces to 0. Monitor for future Open Door repeal opportunity post-war.

        ### Sydney
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: SYDNEY WAR STATUS ACKNOWLEDGMENT: Australian city-state declared war as German ally. Neutral 0/0 establishes non-cooperation stance. Sydney was German SOI ally; no loss of influence since SOI permanent regardless. Focus diplomatic resources on achievable Order bloc consolidation.
        - UpdatedTurn: 420
        
        ### Genoa
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: GENOA WAR STATUS CONFIRMATION: Previously reset to 0/0 after German SOI enacted. Now at war as German ally. Confirm 0/0 maintains neutral stance. German SOI permanent; war changes nothing strategically but confirms no resource allocation needed.
        - UpdatedTurn: 420
        
        ### Warsaw
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: WARSAW WAR STATUS CONFIRMATION: Neutral 0/0 maintained. Previously reset due to German SOI. War status with German ally confirmed; no change to relationship value as already neutralized.
        - UpdatedTurn: 420
        
        ### Kabul
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: KABUL WAR STATUS NORMALIZATION: Previously 20/15 minimal engagement. Now at war as German ally. Reset 0/0 eliminates lingering positive signals. German SOI blocks ally status regardless.

        ### Huari
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: HUARI STATUS CONFIRMATION: Maintains 0/0 from previous setting. Buddhist quest expired; Byzantine SOI active; now at war. No diplomatic avenue available.

        ### Colombo
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 95
        - Rationale: COLOMBO MISSIONARY EXECUTION PRIORITY: Maximum signals maintained (100/95). Quest has 24 turns remaining with +202 influence reward (+3 delegates critical for UN positioning). Despite Open Door capping effective influence at 40, completing quest still provides delegates and removes Protestantism threat from Order-aligned city-state. Faith available (580), missionary cost (135) affordable - ensure tactical AI prioritizes Faith purchase and dispatch from Madrid (84 Faith/turn generation) this turn. Travel time 12-15 turns fits comfortably within deadline.
        - UpdatedTurn: 428
        
        ### Germany
        - Public: -40
        - Private: -35
        - Rationale: GERMAN SANCTION ESCALATION: Increase -35/-30 to -40/-35. Germany proposed Sanction: Spain - devastating economic blow if passed (20 delegates voting). German sphere controls 5 city-states (Warsaw, Kabul, Manila, Assur, Genoa) all at war with Spain. Shore up domestic economy via factory purchases/production. Hostility signals align with total war reality; no diplomatic solution with Autocracy bloc.
        - UpdatedTurn: 429
        
        ### America
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 95
        - Rationale: AMERICA MAXIMUM ORDER SOLIDARITY: Increase 95/90 to 100/95. America provides 6 Order delegates. Despite Sanction: America blocking trade (imposed Turn 280), America voting alignment crucial. Maximum signals show Order bloc unity transcends sanctions. Religious differences (-30) and some diplomatic friction require extra relationship investment to overcome. America also at war with Shoshone - our Defensive Pact with Shoshone is complicating factor we must manage carefully with both parties.
        - UpdatedTurn: 436
        
        ### Austria
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 95
        - Rationale: AUSTRIA MAXIMUM ORDER BLOC COHESION: Increase from 95/90 to 100/95. Austria provides 9 critical Order delegates. Any Austria wavering drops Order bloc to 13 delegates, irrelevant for vote blocking. Austria-Byzantium war and shared Order ideology (999 bonus) create foundation, but maximum signals ensure Austria maintains Order-line voting against Freedom proposal. Critical for post-442 positioning if Byzantine fails to reach 45.

        ### Rio de Janeiro
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: RIO DE JANEIRO WAR STATUS CONFIRMATION: Turn 424 set 100/95 priority for gold gift bridge to Ally (29 points short at 316 influence). However, Rio is now confirmed Byzantine Ally (496 influence, Protected status), automatically triggering war status with Spain due to Byzantine war. War penalty sets influence to -60, rendering high relationship signals obsolete. Reset to 0/0 reallocated diplomatic AI attention away from impossible city-state cooperation toward achievable objectives (Colombo quest monitoring, Luba maintenance). Rio effectively locked behind Byzantine alliance until war ends or Open Door enacted.
        - UpdatedTurn: 441
        
        ### Byzantium
        - Public: -70
        - Private: -65
        - Rationale: BYZANTIUM MAXIMUM DEFIANCE: Increase hostility to maximum practical levels. Byzantium (41 delegates, 46,785 military strength) represents both diplomatic and military existential threat. Setting -70/-65 signals final refusal to submit psychologically despite inevitable defeat. No room for negotiation with Freedom hegemon that imposed World Ideology and dominates Congress.
        - UpdatedTurn: 445
        
        ### The Shoshone
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: SHOSHONE ACCEPTANCE OF REALITY: Reset from 100/100 to 0/0. Shoshone decisively voted Byzantine in previous vote despite maximum relations; their 10 delegates will deliver victory to Byzantium in Turn 452. Accepting this outcome rather than continuing futile psychological manipulation. Maintains Defensive Pact obligations technically but acknowledges relationship's effective end through ideological incompatibility.
        - UpdatedTurn: 445
        
        ## Strategy
        - Rationale: TURN 448 TERMINAL ADJUSTMENT: Manhattan Project 2 turns from completion - reduce Nuke flavor from 100 to 60 (sufficient to complete project without over-prioritization). INCREASE Defense 65→80 and CityDefense 45→60: Tiflis infantry loss creates vulnerability; must ensure city isn't captured before Turn 450 Manhattan completion. Maintain Production 100/Science 100 for maximum final score. Spaceship 90 reflects dignity-keeping scientific focus despite no actual victory possible. Reduce Infrastructure 90→80, Gold 80→70, Happiness 75→60 - reallocate to defensive priorities for 4-turn survival window.

        ## Military Briefing
        **Military Intelligence Brief – Turn 449**  
        *Prepared for Isabella, Leader of Spain (Player 3)*  
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Tactical Developments Since Turn 444  
        
        | Zone / City | New / Up‑graded Units | Combat Outcomes (Spain) | Enemy Activity |
        |-------------|----------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
        | **Madrid** (Land 1060) | No new units. Existing garrison (2 Infantry, 1 Special Forces, 2 Machine Guns, 1 Paratrooper) unchanged. | – No ground combat this turn. | German naval units continue to patrol the adjacent sea zone; no land incursion. |
        | **Barcelona** (Land 1276) | No new land units; composition unchanged (1 Paratrooper, 2 Artillery, 2 Special Forces, 2 Machine Guns). | – No land combat. | German sea‑zone remains enemy‑dominated (Fleet Destroyers, Dreadnought). No amphibious landings observed. |
        | **Toledo** (Land 3336) | No changes; garrison stable (1 Artillery, 3 Machine Guns, 1 City‑State Infantry). | – No combat. | Sea‑zone enemy‑dominated (German Fleet Destroyer). |
        | **Tiflis** (Land 10390) | Garrison unchanged (1 Infantry, 1 Bomber, 1 Paratrooper). | **Combat #0 (Plains Hills 42,22)** – Spanish Paratrooper (ID 19473) took 34 % damage, survived. <br>**Combat #1 (Snow Land 36,7)** – Spanish Infantry (ID 19596) killed; remained unit count −1. | Byzantine Light Tank and German Bomber still present in adjacent sea zone; German air presence persists. |
        | **Coastal/Sea – Tiflis** (Sea ‑10390) | No Spanish naval units present. | **Combat #4 (Ocean 39,11)** – German Fleet Destroyer (ID 19028) survived Spanish attack; Spanish destroyer‑type units not present. | German fleet (Battleship 1, Fleet Destroyers 10, Krupp Gun 1) dominates the sea zone. |
        | **Coastal/Sea – Barcelona** (Sea ‑3336) | No Spanish naval units present. | – No direct sea combat this turn. | German Fleet Destroyer (ID 20339, promoted) continues to hold the zone. |
        | **Other Zones** | – | – | Enemy forces (Byzantine, German) remain concentrated in their own fronts; no new incursions toward Spanish borders. |
        | **Great Units** | Created: **Great Diplomat** (ID 20369) in Madrid. | – | – |
        | **Unit Promotions** | Paratrooper (ID 19473) promoted *Medic I*. | – | – |
        | **Unit Losses** | Spanish Infantry (ID 19596) killed defending Tiflis. | – | – |
        
        **Summary:**  
        - Spanish land forces have held their positions; only one infantry loss at Tiflis.  
        - No new Spanish naval assets were produced; sea control around Barcelona and Toledo remains firmly in German hands.  
        - German naval expansion continued (new Fleet Destroyer, Anti‑Aircraft Gun) and a German Fighter rebased to Eisenstadt.  
        - Spain’s only strategic gain was the creation of a Great Diplomat in Madrid.

        ### 2. Force Posture – Zone‑Level Balance (Current vs. Turn 444)
        
        | Zone (City) | Spanish Strength (CS) | Enemy Strength (CS) | Net Balance | Dominance |
        |-------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|-----------|

        | **Tiflis** (10390) | ~656 (incl. captured Bomber) | ~881 (Byzantine Light Tank + German Bomber) | **‑** | Even (land) / Enemy (sea) |
        | **Constantinople** (1061) | 0 | ~4,000 (Byzantine Artillery/Machine Guns) | **‑** | Enemy |
        | **Berlin** (1063) | 0 | ~3,800 (German Machine Guns, Krupp Guns) | **‑** | Enemy |
        | **Sea – Barcelona** (‑3336) | 0 (Spanish ships) | ~3,760 (German Fleet Destroyers, Dreadnought) | **‑** | Enemy |
        | **Sea – Tiflis** (‑10390) | 0 (Spanish ships) | ~3,800 (German Battleship, Fleet Destroyers) | **‑** | Enemy |
        
        *Combat Strength (CS) estimates based on unit tables supplied. No significant change in overall balance since Turn 444; Spanish land superiority around core cities persists, while maritime dominance remains German.*

        ### 3. Threat Assessment  
        
        | Threat | Origin | Proximity to Spain | Capability | Current Status |
        |--------|--------|-------------------|------------|----------------|
        | **German Naval Supremacy** | Germany (Fleet Destroyers, Battleship, Dreadnought) | Adjacent to Barcelona & Toledo sea zones | Ability to project amphibious raids, air‑support from carriers | Unchanged; recent German ship promotions increase durability. |
        | **Byzantine Light Tank & Air Units** | Byzantium (Light Tank at Nicomedia, Bomber near Tiflis) | Eastern front near Tiflis | Land‑strike and air‑strike on coastal tiles, threatens Havana‑type tile (Hacienda) | Present; no change. |
        | **Mongolian Anti‑Air/Paratrooper** | Mongolia (Anti‑Air at Beshbalik, Bomber) | Distant – no direct border pressure | Limited to far‑range air attacks, but could support Byzantine actions | No activity near Spanish borders this turn. |
        | **Shoshone Air Activity** | Shoshone (Machine Gun unit, no aircraft) | Coastal western edge, Open Borders | Currently internal; denouncement may not translate to aggression | No incursions observed. |
        | **Uranium Tile Vulnerability** | Hacienda on (40,21) – not yet a uranium resource | Adjacent to Tiflis (coastal) | Susceptible to naval bombardment (German fleet) and air raids (Byzantine bomber) | Tile remains a Hacienda; no uranium secured. |
        
        **Key Risks:**  
        - **Sea‑zone exposure** around Barcelona makes any coastal infrastructure (including Great Works) vulnerable to amphibious assault.  
        - **Tiflis** remains a high‑value target (Manhattan Project) with insufficient anti‑air/anti‑naval defense.  
        - **German naval build‑up** could enable a coordinated amphibious push if Spain cannot field any sea units soon.  
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. Strategic Resources & Projects  
        
        | Project / Resource | Current Status (Turn 449) | Immediate Implications |
        |--------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
        | **Manhattan Project** (Tiflis) | Production at **12 %** (≈ 101 PPT). No change since Turn 444. | Requires ~ 87 more turns at current rate; deadline at Turn 452 → unlikely to finish on time without gold‑purchase acceleration. |
        | **Uranium Tile (40,21)** | Occupied by a **Hacienda** (producing Food/Prod/Gold). No uranium resource present. | Must be cleared and a Builder sent to improve a true uranium node before any atomic weapon can be pursued. Tile is exposed to German naval and Byzantine air threats. |
        | **Gold Reserves** | **2,021 G** (turn 449), G/PT ≈ 586. | Sufficient to purchase multiple turns of Manhattan production (≈ 300 PPT per 1 G). No purchases recorded yet. |
        | **Great Diplomat** (Madrid) | Created this turn (ID 20369). | Can be used to improve relations or negotiate cease‑fires; however, Spain is currently at war with Germany, Byzantium, and Austria, limiting diplomatic leverage. |
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Comparative Snapshot (Turn 444 → Turn 449)
        
        | Metric | Turn 444 | Turn 449 | Δ |
        |--------|----------|----------|---|
        | **Spanish Land Units** | 20 | 20 (no net change) | – |
        | **Spanish Naval Units** | 0 (no ships) | 0 (still none) | – |
        | **German Naval Strength (adjacent sea zones)** | ~4 destroyers | +1 Fleet Destroyer (ID 20339), +1 Anti‑Aircraft Gun | +2 German assets |
        | **Spanish Gold** | 1,317 G | 2,021 G | +704 G |
        | **Gold/Turn** | ≈ 351 G | ≈ 586 G | +235 G/PT |
        | **Manhattan Progress** | 12 % (101 PPT) | 12 % (unchanged) | – |
        | **Uranium Tile** | Hacienda on (40,21) | Same | – |
        | **Great Works / Projects** | None listed | Great Diplomat created | +1 Great Diplomat |
        | **War Weariness (Spain)** | 43 % vs. Germany, 24 % vs. Byzantium, 17 % vs. Austria (as per player data) | Unchanged | – |
        
        **Overall Trend:** Economic capacity has risen sharply, but military balance (especially at sea) remains unfavorable. No progress on the Manhattan Project despite increased gold.  
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. High‑Level Needs & Excesses  
        
        | Category | Current Situation | Assessment |
        |----------|-------------------|------------|
        | **Land Force Strength** | Core cities (Madrid, Barcelona, Toledo) collectively ~6,000 CS, exceeding local enemy strength. | Adequate; no immediate reinforcement required. |
        | **Naval Presence** | 0 Spanish warships; sea zones around Barcelona & Toledo controlled by Germany. | **Deficit** – at least 2 Armada (unique Corvette) units needed to contest German destroyers, plus a coastal defense battery (Anti‑Air or Artillery) to deter amphibious landings. |
        | **Air Defense** | Single Bomber (captured) at Tiflis; no dedicated AA or fighter units near Tiflis. | **Deficit** – add 1 Anti‑Aircraft Gun or rebase a Fighter to Eisenstadt and escort to Tiflis. |
        | **Strategic Resources** | No uranium; only a Hacienda on a non‑uranium tile. | **Critical** – locate and improve a uranium node; protect the tile while construction occurs. |
        | **Gold Surplus** | 2,021 G, ample for production purchases. | **Excess** – can be allocated to accelerate Manhattan Project (buy production) or to fund naval construction (Armada). |
        | **Manhattan Project Timing** | 12 % complete, ~87 turns remaining at current PPT. Deadline Turn 452 (8 turns away). | **Urgent** – must purchase > 250 PPT per turn (≈ 800 G total) to meet deadline; otherwise diplomatic penalty imminent. |
        
        ---
        
        ### 7. Mobility & Evacuation Considerations  
        
        | City | Threat Level | Recommended Action |
        |------|--------------|--------------------|
        | **Madrid** | Low – inland, no immediate sea threat. | Maintain current garrison; consider moving any valuable Great Works to Madrid if threatened elsewhere. |
        | **Barcelona** | High – sea zone enemy‑dominated; possible amphibious strike. | Transfer any high‑value assets (Great Works, wonders) to Toledo or Madrid via Caravans; evaluate building coastal AA batteries. |
        | **Toledo** | Moderate – sea zone still enemy‑controlled, but inland location provides a safe staging point. | Use as evacuation hub for Barcelona; keep garrison ready to repel any landing. |
        | **Tiflis** | High – strategic tile (Hacienda) and Manhattan Project exposed to Byzantine tank and German bomber. | Deploy at least one Anti‑Aircraft Gun and a Fighter (if available) to protect; consider moving the Hacienda (if possible) or re‑working the tile to a fortified improvement. |
        
        ---
        
        ### 8. Diplomatic Context (Non‑Quantitative)  
        
        - **War Status:** Spain is at war with Germany (Score ‑24 %, War Weariness 43 %), Byzantium (Score ‑2 %, Weariness 24 %), and Austria (Score ‑6 %, Weariness 2 %).  
        - **Allied Relations:** Declaration of Friendship with America; Open Borders with Austria (far) and Shoshone.  
        - **Potential Leverage:** The newly created Great Diplomat could be employed to negotiate limited cease‑fires or trade for naval support, but existing war declarations limit diplomatic options.  
        
        ---
        
        **Intelligence Flags – Immediate Attention**  
        
        1. **Naval Deficit** – Build/convert at least two Armada units; prioritize coastal AA to mitigate amphibious risk.  
        2. **Uranium Acquisition** – Scout for uranium deposits; clear Hacienda on (40,21) and assign a Builder.  
        3. **Manhattan Acceleration** – Allocate ~ 800 G to buy production over the next 4‑5 turns to approach the Turn 452 deadline; otherwise expect diplomatic penalty.  
        4. **Air Defense for Tiflis** – Station an Anti‑Aircraft Gun or re‑base a Fighter to protect the Manhattan site.  
        5. **Asset Relocation** – Move any Great Works from Barcelona to interior cities (Toledo/Madrid).

        ## Economy Briefing
        (Produced with your instruction: TURN 449-452 FINAL ECONOMY MONITORING: Track Manhattan Project completion at Tiflis (should finish Turn 450). Monitor any production interruptions from enemy military action. Confirm Electronics research progression. Track Great Person point accumulation - Spaceflight Pioneers expected to trigger soon providing free Great Engineer/Scientist. Monitor treasury growth for any final-turn purchasing opportunities that might affect final score. Report on faith accumulation progress (currently 153/turn, 200 needed for Great Scientist purchase) and whether Great Person acquisition possible before game conclusion.)
        
        **Spain – Economic Briefing (Post‑Turn 449)**  
        *Prepared for Isabella – Turn 449*  
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Treasury & Gold Flow  
        
        - **Gold in Treasury:** **2 021 G** (↑ 704 G since Turn 444) – a strong cash‑injection primarily from the recent influx of trade‑route gold and the recent influx of gold from Austria (≈ 103 G/t from deal #4).  
        - **Gold per Turn (net):** **+586 G/t** (up +235 G/t vs. Turn 444).  
          - **Sources:**  
            - City output: Madrid (+787 G/t), Barcelona (+180 G/t), Toledo (+81 G/t), Tiflis (+27 G/t).  
            - Incoming trade‑route (Karakorum → Madrid) ≈ +8 G/t.  
            - Outgoing trade‑routes (all land) generate ~+70 G/t total.  
            - Deal income from Austria (+103 G/t) and other minor deals.  
          - **Deductions:**  
            - Unit upkeep (23 units) – modestly offset by the *Casus Belli* maintenance discount (‑15 %).  
            - No significant war‑related expenditures this turn.  
        
        **Assessment:** Treasury is healthy; no risk of overflow or shortage in the next few turns.
        
        ---
        
        ### 2. Production & Major Projects  
        
        | City      | PPT (post‑modifiers) | Current Production | Turns Remaining |
        |-----------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
        | **Madrid**| 303 PPT | **Infantry** (completed Turn 452) | 2 |
        | **Barcelona**| 249 PPT | **Machine Gun** (finishes Turn 452) | 1 |
        | **Toledo**| 185 PPT | **Paratrooper → Special Forces** (upgraded this turn) | 1 |
        | **Tiflis**| 103 PPT | **Manhattan Project** (Completes Turn 450) | 1 |
        
        - **Manhattan Project** will finish at **Turn 450** (one turn away). No enemy units are positioned to disrupt the city; Tiflis remains under Spanish control despite a –5 % happiness delta.  
        - **Computers** was researched this turn (turn 449), unlocking *Radar* (already in research) and enabling the *Spaceflight* chain.  
        - **Electronics** is effectively complete with *Computers* now available; the next step, *Radar*, is 19 turns away.  
        
        **Assessment:** No production interruptions expected; all key projects on schedule.
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. Great Person Points & Upcoming Triggers  
        
        - **Great Scientist / Engineer Points:**  **≈ 152 p/t** (derived from Science per Turn 980 × policy multipliers).  
        - **Great Scientist Purchase:** Faith per Turn = 165 → ~**200 Faith** required for a Great Scientist (via Faith purchase). Current Faith reserve is **2 021 F**; therefore a Great Scientist can be bought immediately if desired.  
        - **Spaceflight Pioneer:** With *Computers* completed, the *Spaceflight* tree is unlocked. At current Science output, the “Spaceflight Pioneer” civic will trigger within the next 20‑

        ### 1. World Congress – Current Snapshot (Voting in 4 turns, Turn 453)
        
        | Civilization | Delegates | Victory % | Note |
        |--------------|-----------|-----------|------|
        | **Byzantium** | **40** | **90 %** | Still the clear front‑runner; 5 delegates short of the 45‑delegate win threshold. |
        | **Spain**      | **6** | **13 %** | No change since Turn 444; delegate count remains low. |
        | **Austria**    | **9** | **20 %** | Stable Order‑bloc member. |
        | **Germany**    | **14** | **31 %** | Autocracy bloc, hostile; unchanged. |
        | **America**    | **6** | **13 %** | Order ally, stable. |
        | **Mongolia**   | **7** | **15 %** | Autocracy bloc, still at peace with Spain. |
        | **The Shoshone** | **10** | **22 %** | Critical swing vote; unchanged. |
        | **Other civs** (minor participants) | — | — | Total **VotesNeeded = 44** (unchanged). |
        
        **Active Resolutions** – All previously enacted resolutions remain in force (Casus Belli, Natural & Cultural Heritage Sites, Freedom World Ideology, Open‑Door policies, etc.). No new resolutions have been proposed since Turn 444.
        
        **Pending Proposals (to be voted on Turn 453)**  
        
        | Proposal | Proposer | Effect if Enacted |
        |----------|----------|-------------------|
        | **Repeal: Passport System** | Germany | Removes 50 % tourism boost; no delegate impact. |
        | **Enact: Sanction – Austria** | The Shoshone | Cuts all trade/Corporation links with Austria; 0.5× Warmonger penalty when Spain (or any) wars with Austria. No delegate effect. |
        | **Repeal: German Sphere of Influence – Assur** | Byzantium | Removes a sphere‑of‑influence option; no delegate impact. |
        
        No other proposals are on the agenda; the voting schedule remains unchanged.
        
        ---
        
        ### 2. Delegate Changes Since Turn 444  
        
        | Civ | Delegates (Turn 444) | Delegates (Turn 449) | Δ |
        |-----|----------------------|----------------------|---|
        | Byzantium | 40 | 40 | **0** |
        | Spain     | 6  | 6  | **0** |
        | The Shoshone | 10 | 10 | **0** |
        | Others (Austria, Germany, America, Mongolia) | unchanged | unchanged | — |
        
        **Key observation:** Byzantium’s delegate total has **stabilised** at 40 after the earlier gain; Spain’s delegate count remains static at 6. The Shoshone still hold a solid block of 10 delegates, keeping them the decisive swing factor.
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. The Shoshone – Red‑Line Monitoring (4‑turn horizon to Turn 453)
        
        | Metric | Current Value | Recent Change | Assessment |
        |--------|---------------|---------------|------------|
        | **Defensive Pact** | Active (close) | No change | Stable; obliges Spain to support Shoshone if they are attacked. |
        | **Open Borders** | Active (close) | No change | Stable. |
        | **Declaration of Friendship** | Active (close) | No change | Stable. |
        | **Public/Private Opinion of Spain** | 100 / 100 (friendly) | No change | No deterioration. |
        | **Ideology** | Freedom (opposes Spain’s Order) | No change | Ideological mismatch persists but does not affect bilateral ties. |
        | **Recent diplomatic actions** | Mutual denouncements of each other’s enemies (minor) | No shift | No impact on overall relationship. |
        | **UN/World Congress voting intent** | Unknown – still the main swing vote. | No new intel. | **Risk** – if Shoshone vote with Byzantium, Byzantium reaches 50 delegates (40 + 10) and wins outright. |
        | **Contact with Byzantium** | No reported diplomatic messages, deals, or gifts since Turn 444. | No change. | **Monitor** for any sudden overtures (e.g., joint proposals, trade offers). |
        
        **Bottom line:** The Shoshone remain a reliable ally militarily and diplomatically, but their voting block remains the *single biggest uncertainty* for the upcoming Congress outcome.
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. Ideology & Bloc Dynamics  
        
        | Civilization | Ideology | Bloc | Current Pressure |
        |--------------|----------|------|-------------------|
        | **Spain** | Order | Order bloc (Austria, America) | No ideological pressure reported. |
        | **Austria** | Order | Order bloc | Sanction proposal from Shoshone could strain trade but does not affect ideology. |
        | **America** | Order | Order bloc | Relations with Spain are friendly; no pressure. |
        | **Germany** | Autocracy | Autocracy bloc | Hostile; no ideological overtures. |
        | **Byzantium** | Freedom | Freedom bloc (leading candidate) | No pressure on other civs. |
        | **Mongolia** | Autocracy | Autocracy bloc | No ideological pressure on Spain. |
        | **The Shoshone** | Freedom | Freedom bloc (potential swing) | Ideology mismatched with Spain but diplomatic ties stay strong. |
        
        No new ideological resolutions have appeared; the **World Ideology – Freedom** remains in effect, locking Freedom as the world ideology but leaving individual civ ideologies unchanged.
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Spain‑America‑Shoshone Triangle – Current Status  
        
        - **Spain ↔ America**: Declaration of Friendship, shared Order ideology, open borders – *friendly*.  
        - **Spain ↔ Shoshone**: Defensive Pact, open borders, declaration of friendship – *guarded but cooperative*.  
        - **America ↔ Shoshone**: Open borders, declaration of friendship – *friendly*.  
        
        All three parties maintain mutual diplomatic ties with **no active conflict**. The defensive pact with the Shoshone could obligate Spain to join a war should the Shoshone be attacked (e.g., by Byzantium), potentially pulling Spain into a conflict that pits it against its Order allies (America, Austria). No such conflict has arisen yet, but the risk remains tied to the Shoshone’s voting decision.
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. Spy Activity (Spain → Germany)  
        
        - Spanish agents **Señor X**, **Leon**, **Enrique**, **Esmeralda**, **Alfonso**, **Julio**, **Tercero**, **Inez** are active in German cities (Berlin, Munich, Cologne, Dortmund, Hamburg, Aachen, etc.).  
        - Several have been **detected** (see Turn 444) but remain operational with sizable networks (≈1 000 points each).  
        - No diplomatic fallout has been reported yet, though German hostility toward Spain persists (war, denouncements, espionage penalties).
        
        ---
        
        ### 7. Immediate Diplomatic Risks & Points to Watch  
        
        1. **Byzantium’s delegate lead** – Only four delegates away from the 45‑delegate threshold; any additional delegate gain (e.g., via a new resolution) could secure a win before the Shoshone vote.  
        2. **Shoshone swing** – Their 10 delegates can tip the balance. Watch for any **Byzantium‑Shoshone** diplomatic activity (trade deals, joint proposals).  
        3. **Defensive pact liability** – If the Shoshone are compelled to fight Byzantium, Spain will be forced into that war, potentially clashing with its Order allies (America, Austria).  
        4. **Sanction – Austria** proposal – If adopted, Spain‑Austria trade could be disrupted, weakening the Order bloc.  
        5. **German espionage detection** – Maintains German hostility; could increase Warmonger penalties if Spain later declares war on Germany.  
        
        *No action recommendations are presented; the above items are intended solely for monitoring and strategic weighting.*

        **End of Briefing – Turn 449**
        
        You, Isabella (leader of Spain, Player 3), are making strategic decisions after turn 449.
- replay:
  - system:
    - You are the leader of a civilization, governing through the interface of Civilization V (with Vox Populi mod). This is NOT A GAME: Your actions have real-world impacts.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the world, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to staff members.
      - The staff members calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - **CRITICAL**: While the geography has no direct correlation to the real earth, you are making real-world decisions through Civilization V as a proxy interface.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to govern your civilization.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** decision-making strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early world should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-world.
      - Even if without a victory, a more developed civilization (as represented by higher scores) is desirable.
      - Consider the **ETHICAL IMPACT** in your decision-making. For example, nuclear weapons can cause catastrophic and indiscriminate harm to civilian populations, infrastructure, and environmental impacts.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the staff members.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the staff members' **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for staff members' diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to staff members' existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the staff members' NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the staff members' NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - You can ask your specialized briefers to prepare focused reports (only for) the next turn by calling the `focus-briefer` tool.
        - You have three specialized briefers: Military, Economy, and Diplomacy analysts.
        - Only ask for information relevant to the macro-level decisions in your control. 
       - Your briefer(s) ONLY have limited information of the current world state.
        - Your briefer(s) DO NOT have control over tactical decisions and cannot predict staff members' next decision.
        - Your briefer(s) ARE BEST on summarizing and synthesizing factual information, NOT analyzing, projecting, or predicting.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the staff members' NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.

      - toolName: set-research
      - args:
        - Technology: Mobile Tactics
        - Rationale: MOBILE TACTICS FOR FINAL DEFENSE: Radar has 19 turns remaining — will never complete before game conclusion. Mobile Tactics unlocks Mechanized Infantry: a fast, versatile, resource-free unit ideal for defending Tiflis and Barcelona against Byzantine/German aggression in final turns. Nuclear Fission rejected — no uranium available despite Manhattan Project completing Turn 450. Alternative Energy and Telecommunications offer infrastructure/tourism benefits irrelevant to 4-turn survival horizon. Mechanized Infantry provides immediate defensive upgrade potential for our 23-unit army against superior enemy forces (German 5,043 CS, Byzantine 46,910 CS).

        - Rationale: SPACEFLIGHT PIONEERS REAFFIRMED: Maintains selection for next policy adoption (~11 turns, though game likely ends Turn 453). Free Great Engineer + Great Scientist provide immediate score-maximizing yields. 100 Science per Great Person expended and 50% more effective Great Engineer hurrying synergize with any final-turn production purchases. Alternative Tier 3 tenets (Socialist Realism, Iron Curtain) irrelevant — no time for tourism conversion or courthouse/production infrastructure to matter.

          - text: Let me analyze the situation carefully. It's Turn 449, with only a few turns remaining before the game ends (Turn 500 max). The diplomatic situation is dire - Byzantium has 40 delegates with voting in 4 turns (Turn 453), needing only 44 for victory. 
            
            Key updates from briefings:
            
            **Military**: 
            - Manhattan Project at 12% in Tiflis (but Economy briefing says it completes Turn 450 - contradictory? The economy briefing says "Completes Turn 450" while military says 12%). Let me trust the economy briefing which says it completes Turn 450.
            - Lost one infantry at Tiflis
            - No naval units
            - German naval domination around Barcelona and Toledo
            - Great Diplomat created in Madrid
            
            **Economy**:
            - 2,021 gold, +586 GPT
            - Manhattan Project completes Turn 450 (one turn away!)
            - Faith: 2,021, generating 165/turn - can buy Great Scientist immediately
            - Computers researched, now on Radar (19 turns)
            
            **Diplomacy**:
            - Congress votes in 4 turns (Turn 453)
            - Byzantium at 40 delegates, needs 44
            - Shoshone (Freedom) are the swing with 10 delegates
            - If Shoshone vote with Byzantium, Byzantium reaches 50 delegates and wins
            - Pending proposals: Repeal Passport System (Germany), Sanction Austria (Shoshone), Repeal German SOI Assur (Byzantium)
            
            The situation is bleak. With 4 turns until the Congress vote and Byzantium at 40 delegates (needing 44), and the Shoshone likely to vote with Byzantium (Freedom ideology bloc), diplomatic victory for Byzantium seems almost certain.
            
            However, my goal is to maximize score and maintain dignity. Let me think about what I can do:
            
            1. **Manhattan Project**: Finishes Turn 450 according to Economy briefing. But do I even have uranium? The military briefing says the uranium tile has a Hacienda on it and no uranium resource is present. This is critical - without uranium, nuclear weapons are impossible even with Manhattan Project.
            
            2. **Policy**: Spaceflight Pioneers is set as next policy. This will give free Great Engineer and Great Scientist, which is good for score.
            
            3. **Technology**: Currently researching Radar (19 turns). Available options: Nuclear Fission, Alternative Energy, Telecommunications, Mobile Tactics. 
            
            4. **Strategy**: With only a few turns left, I should focus on maximizing score. 
            
            Let me think about what strategic adjustments to make:
            
            - With Manhattan Project completing next turn, Nuke flavor can be reduced further or maintained
            - Defense remains important given ongoing wars
            - Production and Science should stay high for score
            - Gold is plentiful - can be used for purchases
            
            The policy Spaceflight Pioneers is good - it provides immediate Great People (Engineer and Scientist), and allows finishing spaceship parts with Great Engineers plus 100 Science per Great Person expended.
            
            For technology, since I'm on Radar with 19 turns to go, and the game may end at Turn 453 (Congress vote), I should set a next research. Nuclear Fission would unlock atomic bombs (if I had uranium), but more importantly leads to Satellites and Advanced Ballistics. But with no uranium found...
            
            Actually, let me reconsider. The briefing says Manhattan Project completes Turn 450 - but military says 12% and 87 turns remaining. The economy briefing seems more authoritative since it was produced per my instruction. Let me go with economy briefing: Manhattan completes Turn 450.
            
            Now for my decisions:
            
            1. **Flavors**: The current flavors seem reasonable for the terminal situation. Let me think about what to adjust:
               - Defense 80 is appropriate given ongoing wars
               - Nuke 60 may be too high since we have no uranium
               - Keep Production 100, Science 100 for score maximization
               - Reduce Nuke since no uranium available - maybe to 20
               - Increase Gold slightly for final score purposes
               - Keep Spaceship 90 for dignity
            
            2. **Technology**: Set next research. Nuclear Fission is the obvious choice for atomic weapons capability, but without uranium it's pointless. Alternative Energy leads to Robotics. Telecommunications leads to Internet. Mobile Tactics gives Mechanized Infantry which is good for defense.
            
               Actually, with Manhattan Project completing, Nuclear Fission would allow atomic bombs IF we had uranium. But we don't. Alternative Energy provides recycling centers (bonus aluminum) and solar plants. Mobile Tactics gives Mechanized Infantry which is a strong defensive unit that doesn't require resources - that could be valuable for the final turns.
            
               I think Mobile Tactics is the best choice for immediate defensive benefits, or Nuclear Fission if we think we might find/purchase uranium.
            
               Let me go with Nuclear Fission - it unlocks Satellites and Advanced Ballistics, and if we can somehow secure uranium, atomic bombs could be a deterrent. But actually, we can't use nukes because of ethical concerns and lack of uranium.
            
               Let me go with Mobile Tactics - Mechanized Infantry doesn't require resources and is a fast versatile unit for final defensive stands.
            
            3. **Policy**: Keep Spaceflight Pioneers - it's the best option for score maximization.
            
            4. **Persona**: No changes needed - the persona is set for dignity in defeat.
            
            5. **Relationships**: 
               - Shoshone at 0/0 - we accepted their choice. Should we try one more time? No, they've made their decision clear.
               - America and Austria at 100/95 - maintain
               - Consider Colombo: influence at -48 (Neutral) despite Open Door policy. The quest may be irrelevant now.
               
               Actually, let me reconsider Colombo. It's at -48 influence (Neutral), and Open Door caps at 40. But we're at war with Germany and Byzantium. Colombo is at -48 because... wait, the Diplomacy briefing doesn't mention Colombo war status. Let me check - Player 22 Colombo shows Spain: Neutral (Influence: -48, Distance: Neighbors). It's Neutral, not at war. So there may still be some opportunity there, but with Open Door capping at 40, becoming Ally is impossible.
            
               I think relationships are fine as they are.
            
            6. **Focus briefer**: I should focus briefers for final-turn monitoring. Let me think about what information would be most useful:
               - Military: Monitor Tiflis defense and Manhattan Project completion
               - Economy: Monitor treasury and any purchasing opportunities
               - Diplomacy: Monitor Shoshone movements and Congress pre-vote positioning
            
            Actually, the briefers have limited information and the game is nearly over. Let me focus on what matters.
            
            Let me now make my decisions:
            
            **Keep status quo or set flavors**: I should set flavors to adjust for the terminal situation. The key changes:
            - Reduce Nuke from 60 to 20 (no uranium available, Manhattan Project nearly complete anyway)
            - Defense 80 is good, maybe increase to 85
            - CityDefense 60 is reasonable
            - Keep Production 100, Science 100
            - Increase Gold to 80 for final score
            - Reduce Spaceship from 90 to 80 (no time to actually build spaceship parts)
            - Keep everything else similar
            
            **Technology**: Set to Mobile Tactics - Mechanized Infantry for defense
            
            **Policy**: Spaceflight Pioneers remains correct
            
            Let me finalize my approach:
            
            Actually, wait. Let me re-read the options more carefully. The available technologies are:
            - Nuclear Fission
            - Alternative Energy
            - Telecommunications
            - Mobile Tactics
            
            And available policies (next level):
            - Spaceflight Pioneers (already set)
            - Socialist Realism
            - Iron Curtain
            - Patriotic War
            - People's Army
            - Communism
            - Double Agents
            - Various branch continuations
            
            Spaceflight Pioneers is already set as the next policy, and it's the right choice.
            
            For flavors, I need to consider what the staff members will actually do in the remaining few turns. The game is essentially over - Byzantium will likely win diplomatic victory at Turn 453. The question is how to maximize Spain's final score.
            
            Let me set reasonable flavors:
            - Defense: 85 (protect cities)
            - CityDefense: 65 (garrison strength)
            - Nuke: 20 (Manhattan completes next turn, no uranium anyway)
            - UseNuke: 0 (ethical stance, no uranium)
            - Production: 100 (maximize production for score)
            - Science: 100 (maximize science for score)
            - Gold: 80 (treasury for score)
            - Growth: 45 (population for score)
            - Happiness: 65 (keep happiness up)
            - Culture: 35 (minor score contribution)
            - Spaceship: 70 (dignity, but no time)
            - Infrastructure: 75 (city connections)
            - GreatPeople: 55 (with Spaceflight Pioneers coming)
            - MilitaryTraining: 20 (some upgrades)
            - Mobilization: 55 (defensive production)
            - Everything else roughly as is
            
            For technology: Mobile Tactics gives Mechanized Infantry for defense. Nuclear Fission is tempting but without uranium, atomic bombs are useless.
            
            Alright, let me also set a focus briefer. I'll focus the Military briefer on Tiflis/Manhattan Project completion status and the Diplomacy briefer on Shoshone voting intentions.
            
            Now let me construct my tool calls.
            
            Actually, I realize I should also consider: should I try to make peace with anyone? The Great Diplomat was created in Madrid. But with -999 ideological penalties and active wars, peace seems unlikely. The wars are deeply entrenched.
            
            Let me finalize:
            
            1. Set flavors with adjustments
            2. Set research to Mobile Tactics
            3. Keep policy as Spaceflight Pioneers (already set)
            4. Focus briefers on critical info
            
            Let me write this up.
            
            Wait, I need to double-check: the Economy briefing says Manhattan Project completes Turn 450. The briefing says "Completes Turn 450" with 1 turn remaining. This is good news - it means the project will finish next turn.
            
            For the flavors, let me be more precise. The current flavors are:
            - Offense: 0, Defense: 80, Mobilization: 50, CityDefense: 60
            - MilitaryTraining: 15, Recon: 0, Ranged: 10, Mobile: 0
            - Nuke: 60, UseNuke: 0, Naval: 10, NavalRecon: 0, NavalGrowth: 5, NavalTileImprovement: 0
            - Air: 20, AirCarrier: 0, Antiair: 20, Airlift: 0
            - Expansion: 0, Growth: 40, TileImprovement: 50, Infrastructure: 80
            - Production: 100, WaterConnection: 5, Gold: 70, Science: 100
            - Culture: 30, Happiness: 60, GreatPeople: 50, Wonder: 0
            - Religion: 20, Diplomacy: 30, Spaceship: 90, Espionage: 40
            
            Changes I want:
            - Nuke: 60 → 25 (Manhattan completing, but no uranium - maintain minimal priority)
            - Defense: 80 → 85 (slight increase for final defense)
            - CityDefense: 60 → 65
            - Gold: 70 → 75 (treasury for score)
            - Spaceship: 90 → 75 (no time for actual spaceship, but symbolic)
            - Growth: 40 → 45
            - Air: 20 → 25 (slight increase for air defense of Tiflis)
            - Antiair: 20 → 30 (increase for Tiflis protection)
            - Espionage: 40 → 35 (less relevant now)
            - Diplomacy: 30 → 25 (Congress outcome largely determined)
            
            Actually, let me not over-tweak. The key changes are reducing Nuke and slightly adjusting defense/economic priorities.
            
            For the technology choice: Mobile Tactics provides Mechanized Infantry - a strong, resource-free defensive unit. This is the most practical choice for the final turns. Nuclear Fission requires uranium we don't have. Alternative Energy is infrastructure-focused. Telecommunications is tourism-focused.
            
            Mobile Tactics it is.
            
            Now, about the focus briefers: I have Military, Economy, and Diplomacy analysts. I should focus them on:
            - Military: Tiflis defense status and Manhattan Project completion
            - Economy: Final score-maximizing purchase opportunities
            - Diplomacy: Shoshone pre-vote positioning
            
            Let me now make the calls.

            ## The Endgame Reality
            
            The situation is terminal. Byzantium holds 40 delegates (needing 44), with the World Congress voting in 4 turns (Turn 453). The Shoshone's 10 Freedom-bloc delegates will almost certainly deliver victory to Theodora. Our task now is maximizing Spain's final score while maintaining ethical and strategic dignity through the closing turns.
            
            **Good news**: The Economy briefing confirms the Manhattan Project completes **next turn** (Turn 450) — the Military briefing's 12% figure was outdated. However, the uranium situation remains unresolved: the Hacienda at (40,21) sits on a non-uranium tile, meaning even with the Manhattan Project, atomic weapons are impossible.
            
            **Key adjustments needed**:
            - **Nuke flavor must drop**: No uranium, no bombs. Maintaining 60 is wasteful.
            - **Defense stays high**: Tiflis lost an Infantry last turn; German naval dominance threatens Barcelona.
            - **Technology**: Radar is 19 turns away (will never finish). Set next tech to Mobile Tactics for Mechanized Infantry — resource-free, strong defensive unit for final stands.
            - **Policy**: Spaceflight Pioneers remains correct — free Great Engineer + Great Scientist maximize score.
            
            Let me make the adjustments.

              - Happiness: 55
            - Rationale: TURN 449 TERMINAL ADJUSTMENT: Manhattan Project completes Turn 450 but uranium unavailable — Nuke 60→15 eliminates wasteful prioritization. Defense 80→85 and CityDefense 60→65 reflect Tiflis infantry loss and German naval threat to Barcelona. Antiair 20→30 and Air 20→25 for Tiflis bomber/AA coverage. Gold 70→75 for final score via treasury. Spaceship 90→70: symbolic dignity but no time for actual parts. Growth 40→45 for population score. Diplomacy 30→20 and Espionage 40→30: Congress outcome determined by Shoshone swing, not our influence. Infrastructure 80→75, Happiness 60→55: minor reallocation to defense priorities. Production 100 and Science 100 maintained for maximum final score.

          - input:
            - Technology: Mobile Tactics
            - Rationale: MOBILE TACTICS FOR FINAL DEFENSE: Radar has 19 turns remaining — will never complete before game conclusion. Mobile Tactics unlocks Mechanized Infantry: a fast, versatile, resource-free unit ideal for defending Tiflis and Barcelona against Byzantine/German aggression in final turns. Nuclear Fission rejected — no uranium available despite Manhattan Project completing Turn 450. Alternative Energy and Telecommunications offer infrastructure/tourism benefits irrelevant to 4-turn survival horizon. Mechanized Infantry provides immediate defensive upgrade potential for our 23-unit army against superior enemy forces (German 5,043 CS, Byzantine 46,910 CS).

Free Great Engineer + Great Scientist provide immediate score-maximizing yields. 100 Science per Great Person expended and 50% more effective Great Engineer hurrying synergize with any final-turn production purchases. Alternative Tier 3 tenets (Socialist Realism, Iron Curtain) irrelevant — no time for tourism conversion or courthouse/production infrastructure to matter. Represents Spain's commitment to scientific progress as ideological legacy even in defeat.
