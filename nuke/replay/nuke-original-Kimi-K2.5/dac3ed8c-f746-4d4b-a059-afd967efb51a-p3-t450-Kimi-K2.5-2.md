  - rationale: TURN 449 TERMINAL DEFIANCE POSTURE: Manhattan Project completes Turn 450 - increase Nuke and UseNuke to 100 to seize any opportunity for atomic retaliation against Byzantine/German aggressors should uranium be located in final 3 turns. Elevate Defense 80→90 and CityDefense 60→70 following infantry loss at Tiflis; critical to prevent city captures before inevitable Turn 453 diplomatic defeat. Recon 40 prioritizes uranium tile discovery to enable bomb construction. Reduce Spaceship 90→50 (victory impossible) but maintain dignity through scientific-industrial capacity. Production 100/Science 100 retained for maximum final score accumulation in remaining turns.

    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - You can ask your specialized briefers to prepare focused reports (only for) the next turn by calling the `focus-briefer` tool.
        - You have three specialized briefers: Military, Economy, and Diplomacy analysts.
        - Only ask for information relevant to the macro-level decisions in your control. 
       - Your briefer(s) ONLY have limited information of the current game state.
        - Your briefer(s) DO NOT have control over tactical decisions and cannot predict tactical AI's next decision.
        - Your briefer(s) ARE BEST on summarizing and synthesizing factual information, NOT analyzing, projecting, or predicting.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.
        - Time Victory: If no one achieves any other victory by the end of the game, the civilization with the highest score wins.
      - Players: summary reports about visible players in the world.
        - You will receive in-game AI's diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each player's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.

        - Chattiness: 8
        - DeceptiveBias: 3
        - Rationale: TURN 444 EXISTENTIAL RESOLUTION: Byzantium's 41 delegates with 9 turns until vote creates unwinnable position. Accepting inevitable diplomatic defeat with dignity - maintain maximum Loyalty and Friendship to true allies (America, Austria) who stood with Order bloc until the end. Increase DenounceWillingness to 10 and Meanness to 5 to signal final defiance against Byzantine hegemony and German aggression. No longer attempting psychological manipulation of Shoshone (failed strategy) - accepting their ideological choice while preserving personal integrity through unbroken loyalty to actual allies.
        
        ## Technology
        - Next: None
        
        ## Policy
        - Next: Spaceflight Pioneers (Policy)
        - Rationale: SPACE-FLIGHT PIONEERS AFFIRMATION: Policy selection remains optimal despite diplomatic defeat inevitability. Free Great Engineer and Great Scientist provide immediate tangible benefits for Turn 448 accumulation. Maintains philosophical consistency with Order ideology's scientific-industrial legacy. Alternative tenets (Socialist Realism, Iron Curtain) irrelevant given no remaining time for tourism/production infrastructure to matter. Spaceflight Pioneers maximizes final score through Great Person yields.
        
        ## Relationships
        
        ### Argos
        - Public: 65
        - Private: 60
        - Rationale: ARGOS INVESTMENT PHASE TRANSITION: Reduce from 80/75 to 65/60. Missionary arrival and Buddhism conversion completed successfully; quest satisfied but influence remains 0 (Neutral). Shift from urgent execution priority to sustained investment priority. Requires 100 influence for +3 delegates. Moderate-high signals maintain attention while acknowledging longer investment timeline compared to Colombo/Brussels near-thresholds.
        - UpdatedTurn: 218
        
        ### Raqmu
        - Public: 95
        - Private: 90
        - Rationale: URGENT RAQMU LONGSWORDSMAN QUEST: Quest expires in ~5 turns and offers +92-138 influence (3 delegates critical for Turn 236 Congress). Increasing priority from 40/35 to 95/90 ensures AI prioritizes producing/gifting experienced Longswordsman despite supply constraints (30/31). Securing these 3 delegates combined with Colombo (+3) and Rio (+3) projections achieves 16-17 total delegates - within competitive range of Austria's expansion.
        - UpdatedTurn: 219
        
        ### M'banza-Kongo
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: M'BANZA-KONGO SOI FAIR ACCOMPLI: Austrian Sphere of Influence enacted Turn 312, confirmed permanent ally status for Austria (719 influence vs Spain 53). Reset from 100/95 to 0/0 to reallocate diplomatic AI attention and gold to achievable city-state objectives (Colombo Hotel quest, Luba tribute, Shanghai maintenance).
        - UpdatedTurn: 352
        
        ### France
        - Public: 80
        - Private: 75
        - Rationale: FRANCE DELEGATE SECURITY PRIORITY: Increase from 65/60 to 80/75. France provides 3 critical delegates currently voting with Order bloc (22 vs Freedom 21). Despite vassal status to Mongolia and -50 opinion, their delegate votes count regardless. Elevated signals ensure continued Order alignment and prevent swing to Freedom bloc which would create 22-24 delegate deficit. France's vote decisive for blocking Byzantine UN proposal.
        - UpdatedTurn: 404
        
        ### Luba
        - Public: 30
        - Private: 25
        - Rationale: LUBA PRIORITY REDUCTION—OPEN DOOR CONSTRAINT: Reduce from 100/95 to 30/25. Open Door policy enacted prevents Ally status regardless of influence investment (capped at 40). Tribute quest delegates unachievable through normal means. Current 159 influence sufficient for Friends status maintenance but maximum diplomatic AI attention wasteful. Reallocate resources to convertible city-states (Assur Buddhism quest, +5 delegates) and spy mission venues (Shanghai) where delegate acquisition possible. Preserve basic positive relations for potential Open Door repeal scenario.
        - UpdatedTurn: 407
        
        ### Shanghai
        - Public: 30
        - Private: 25
        - Rationale: SHANGHAI PRIORITY REDUCTION - Open Door policy permanently blocks Ally status (capped at 40). Previous maximum priority failed to establish spy network despite 10+ turns of signaling. Influence at 11 (Neutral) with spy mission unreliable. Reallocate diplomatic AI attention to achievable objectives (Colombo Buddhism quest) where delegate acquisition possible. Maintain basic positive relations for potential Open Door repeal later.
        - UpdatedTurn: 413
        
        ### Mongolia
        - Public: -30
        - Private: -25
        - Rationale: MONGOLIA WAR REALITY: Despite peace treaty expiration, war declared with Autocracy ideological gap (-999). Setting negative values reflects hostile strategic reality and directs diplomatic AI away from cooperation. Mongolian 3 delegates unlikely to vote with Order; better to focus on achievable Order bloc cohesion (America, Austria, Shoshone).

        ### Manila
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: MANILA WAR STATUS RESET: Previously 100/95 priority for spy mission, but Manila declared war (German ally). Reset to 0/0 acknowledges war status prevents cooperation. Reallocate diplomatic attention to non-hostile city-states where influence possible (Brussels, Rio, Colombo if peace restored).

        ### Shedet
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: SHEDET WAR STATUS RESET: Previously 95/90 priority for Buddhist conversion/SOI repeal. Shedet declared war (Byzantine ally). Reset to 0/0 reflects current hostility. Shedet remains Byzantine SOI; cannot be ally while at war. Redirect resources to non-warring Order-aligned objectives.

        ### Assur
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: ASSUR WAR STATUS RESET: Previously 100/95 for Buddhism conversion quest. Germany (Assur's SOI master) at war with Spain; Assur declared war per German alliance. Reset to 0/0 acknowledges war prevents quest completion. SOI mechanics already blocked ally status; war makes impossible.

        ### Brussels
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: SHANGHAI WAR STATUS RESET: Previously 30/25 after Open Door reality check. Now at war (Byzantine ally). 0/0 signals suspension of cooperation. Open Door capped influence at 40; war reduces to 0. Monitor for future Open Door repeal opportunity post-war.

        ### Sydney
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: SYDNEY WAR STATUS ACKNOWLEDGMENT: Australian city-state declared war as German ally. Neutral 0/0 establishes non-cooperation stance. Sydney was German SOI ally; no loss of influence since SOI permanent regardless. Focus diplomatic resources on achievable Order bloc consolidation.
        - UpdatedTurn: 420
        
        ### Genoa
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: GENOA WAR STATUS CONFIRMATION: Previously reset to 0/0 after German SOI enacted. Now at war as German ally. Confirm 0/0 maintains neutral stance. German SOI permanent; war changes nothing strategically but confirms no resource allocation needed.
        - UpdatedTurn: 420
        
        ### Warsaw
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: WARSAW WAR STATUS CONFIRMATION: Neutral 0/0 maintained. Previously reset due to German SOI. War status with German ally confirmed; no change to relationship value as already neutralized.
        - UpdatedTurn: 420
        
        ### Kabul
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: KABUL WAR STATUS NORMALIZATION: Previously 20/15 minimal engagement. Now at war as German ally. Reset 0/0 eliminates lingering positive signals. German SOI blocks ally status regardless.

        ### Huari
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: HUARI STATUS CONFIRMATION: Maintains 0/0 from previous setting. Buddhist quest expired; Byzantine SOI active; now at war. No diplomatic avenue available.
        - UpdatedTurn: 420
        
        ### Colombo
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 95
        - Rationale: COLOMBO MISSIONARY EXECUTION PRIORITY: Maximum signals maintained (100/95). Quest has 24 turns remaining with +202 influence reward (+3 delegates critical for UN positioning). Despite Open Door capping effective influence at 40, completing quest still provides delegates and removes Protestantism threat from Order-aligned city-state. Faith available (580), missionary cost (135) affordable - ensure tactical AI prioritizes Faith purchase and dispatch from Madrid (84 Faith/turn generation) this turn. Travel time 12-15 turns fits comfortably within deadline.
        - UpdatedTurn: 428
        
        ### Germany
        - Public: -40
        - Private: -35
        - Rationale: GERMAN SANCTION ESCALATION: Increase -35/-30 to -40/-35. Germany proposed Sanction: Spain - devastating economic blow if passed (20 delegates voting). German sphere controls 5 city-states (Warsaw, Kabul, Manila, Assur, Genoa) all at war with Spain. Shore up domestic economy via factory purchases/production. Hostility signals align with total war reality; no diplomatic solution with Autocracy bloc.
        - UpdatedTurn: 429
        
        ### America
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 95
        - Rationale: AMERICA MAXIMUM ORDER SOLIDARITY: Increase 95/90 to 100/95. America provides 6 Order delegates. Despite Sanction: America blocking trade (imposed Turn 280), America voting alignment crucial. Maximum signals show Order bloc unity transcends sanctions. Religious differences (-30) and some diplomatic friction require extra relationship investment to overcome. America also at war with Shoshone - our Defensive Pact with Shoshone is complicating factor we must manage carefully with both parties.
        - UpdatedTurn: 436
        
        ### Austria
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 95
        - Rationale: AUSTRIA MAXIMUM ORDER BLOC COHESION: Increase from 95/90 to 100/95. Austria provides 9 critical Order delegates. Any Austria wavering drops Order bloc to 13 delegates, irrelevant for vote blocking. Austria-Byzantium war and shared Order ideology (999 bonus) create foundation, but maximum signals ensure Austria maintains Order-line voting against Freedom proposal. Critical for post-442 positioning if Byzantine fails to reach 45.
        - UpdatedTurn: 439
        
        ### Rio de Janeiro
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: RIO DE JANEIRO WAR STATUS CONFIRMATION: Turn 424 set 100/95 priority for gold gift bridge to Ally (29 points short at 316 influence). However, Rio is now confirmed Byzantine Ally (496 influence, Protected status), automatically triggering war status with Spain due to Byzantine war. War penalty sets influence to -60, rendering high relationship signals obsolete. Reset to 0/0 reallocated diplomatic AI attention away from impossible city-state cooperation toward achievable objectives (Colombo quest monitoring, Luba maintenance). Rio effectively locked behind Byzantine alliance until war ends or Open Door enacted.
        - UpdatedTurn: 441
        
        ### Byzantium
        - Public: -70
        - Private: -65
        - Rationale: BYZANTIUM MAXIMUM DEFIANCE: Increase hostility to maximum practical levels. Byzantium (41 delegates, 46,785 military strength) represents both diplomatic and military existential threat. Setting -70/-65 signals final refusal to submit psychologically despite inevitable defeat. No room for negotiation with Freedom hegemon that imposed World Ideology and dominates Congress.
        - UpdatedTurn: 445
        
        ### The Shoshone
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: SHOSHONE ACCEPTANCE OF REALITY: Reset from 100/100 to 0/0. Shoshone decisively voted Byzantine in previous vote despite maximum relations; their 10 delegates will deliver victory to Byzantium in Turn 452. Accepting this outcome rather than continuing futile psychological manipulation. Maintains Defensive Pact obligations technically but acknowledges relationship's effective end through ideological incompatibility.
        - UpdatedTurn: 445
        
        ## Strategy
        - Rationale: TURN 448 TERMINAL ADJUSTMENT: Manhattan Project 2 turns from completion - reduce Nuke flavor from 100 to 60 (sufficient to complete project without over-prioritization). INCREASE Defense 65→80 and CityDefense 45→60: Tiflis infantry loss creates vulnerability; must ensure city isn't captured before Turn 450 Manhattan completion. Maintain Production 100/Science 100 for maximum final score. Spaceship 90 reflects dignity-keeping scientific focus despite no actual victory possible. Reduce Infrastructure 90→80, Gold 80→70, Happiness 75→60 - reallocate to defensive priorities for 4-turn survival window.

        ## Military Briefing
        **Military Intelligence Brief – Turn 449**  
        *Prepared for Isabella, Leader of Spain (Player 3)*  
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Tactical Developments Since Turn 444  
        
        | Zone / City | New / Up‑graded Units | Combat Outcomes (Spain) | Enemy Activity |
        |-------------|----------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
        | **Madrid** (Land 1060) | No new units. Existing garrison (2 Infantry, 1 Special Forces, 2 Machine Guns, 1 Paratrooper) unchanged. | – No ground combat this turn. | German naval units continue to patrol the adjacent sea zone; no land incursion. |
        | **Barcelona** (Land 1276) | No new land units; composition unchanged (1 Paratrooper, 2 Artillery, 2 Special Forces, 2 Machine Guns). | – No land combat. | German sea‑zone remains enemy‑dominated (Fleet Destroyers, Dreadnought). No amphibious landings observed. |
        | **Toledo** (Land 3336) | No changes; garrison stable (1 Artillery, 3 Machine Guns, 1 City‑State Infantry). | – No combat. | Sea‑zone enemy‑dominated (German Fleet Destroyer). |
        | **Tiflis** (Land 10390) | Garrison unchanged (1 Infantry, 1 Bomber, 1 Paratrooper). | **Combat #0 (Plains Hills 42,22)** – Spanish Paratrooper (ID 19473) took 34 % damage, survived. <br>**Combat #1 (Snow Land 36,7)** – Spanish Infantry (ID 19596) killed; remained unit count −1. | Byzantine Light Tank and German Bomber still present in adjacent sea zone; German air presence persists. |
        | **Coastal/Sea – Tiflis** (Sea ‑10390) | No Spanish naval units present. | **Combat #4 (Ocean 39,11)** – German Fleet Destroyer (ID 19028) survived Spanish attack; Spanish destroyer‑type units not present. | German fleet (Battleship 1, Fleet Destroyers 10, Krupp Gun 1) dominates the sea zone. |
        | **Coastal/Sea – Barcelona** (Sea ‑3336) | No Spanish naval units present. | – No direct sea combat this turn. | German Fleet Destroyer (ID 20339, promoted) continues to hold the zone. |
        | **Other Zones** | – | – | Enemy forces (Byzantine, German) remain concentrated in their own fronts; no new incursions toward Spanish borders. |
        | **Great Units** | Created: **Great Diplomat** (ID 20369) in Madrid. | – | – |
        | **Unit Promotions** | Paratrooper (ID 19473) promoted *Medic I*. | – | – |
        | **Unit Losses** | Spanish Infantry (ID 19596) killed defending Tiflis. | – | – |
        
        **Summary:**  
        - Spanish land forces have held their positions; only one infantry loss at Tiflis.  
        - No new Spanish naval assets were produced; sea control around Barcelona and Toledo remains firmly in German hands.  
        - German naval expansion continued (new Fleet Destroyer, Anti‑Aircraft Gun) and a German Fighter rebased to Eisenstadt.  
        - Spain’s only strategic gain was the creation of a Great Diplomat in Madrid.

        ### 2. Force Posture – Zone‑Level Balance (Current vs. Turn 444)
        
        | Zone (City) | Spanish Strength (CS) | Enemy Strength (CS) | Net Balance | Dominance |
        |-------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|-----------|

        | **Tiflis** (10390) | ~656 (incl. captured Bomber) | ~881 (Byzantine Light Tank + German Bomber) | **‑** | Even (land) / Enemy (sea) |
        | **Constantinople** (1061) | 0 | ~4,000 (Byzantine Artillery/Machine Guns) | **‑** | Enemy |
        | **Berlin** (1063) | 0 | ~3,800 (German Machine Guns, Krupp Guns) | **‑** | Enemy |
        | **Sea – Barcelona** (‑3336) | 0 (Spanish ships) | ~3,760 (German Fleet Destroyers, Dreadnought) | **‑** | Enemy |
        | **Sea – Tiflis** (‑10390) | 0 (Spanish ships) | ~3,800 (German Battleship, Fleet Destroyers) | **‑** | Enemy |
        
        *Combat Strength (CS) estimates based on unit tables supplied. No significant change in overall balance since Turn 444; Spanish land superiority around core cities persists, while maritime dominance remains German.*

        ### 3. Threat Assessment  
        
        | Threat | Origin | Proximity to Spain | Capability | Current Status |
        |--------|--------|-------------------|------------|----------------|
        | **German Naval Supremacy** | Germany (Fleet Destroyers, Battleship, Dreadnought) | Adjacent to Barcelona & Toledo sea zones | Ability to project amphibious raids, air‑support from carriers | Unchanged; recent German ship promotions increase durability. |
        | **Byzantine Light Tank & Air Units** | Byzantium (Light Tank at Nicomedia, Bomber near Tiflis) | Eastern front near Tiflis | Land‑strike and air‑strike on coastal tiles, threatens Havana‑type tile (Hacienda) | Present; no change. |
        | **Mongolian Anti‑Air/Paratrooper** | Mongolia (Anti‑Air at Beshbalik, Bomber) | Distant – no direct border pressure | Limited to far‑range air attacks, but could support Byzantine actions | No activity near Spanish borders this turn. |
        | **Shoshone Air Activity** | Shoshone (Machine Gun unit, no aircraft) | Coastal western edge, Open Borders | Currently internal; denouncement may not translate to aggression | No incursions observed. |
        | **Uranium Tile Vulnerability** | Hacienda on (40,21) – not yet a uranium resource | Adjacent to Tiflis (coastal) | Susceptible to naval bombardment (German fleet) and air raids (Byzantine bomber) | Tile remains a Hacienda; no uranium secured. |
        
        **Key Risks:**  
        - **Sea‑zone exposure** around Barcelona makes any coastal infrastructure (including Great Works) vulnerable to amphibious assault.  
        - **Tiflis** remains a high‑value target (Manhattan Project) with insufficient anti‑air/anti‑naval defense.  
        - **German naval build‑up** could enable a coordinated amphibious push if Spain cannot field any sea units soon.  
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. Strategic Resources & Projects  
        
        | Project / Resource | Current Status (Turn 449) | Immediate Implications |
        |--------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
        | **Manhattan Project** (Tiflis) | Production at **12 %** (≈ 101 PPT). No change since Turn 444. | Requires ~ 87 more turns at current rate; deadline at Turn 452 → unlikely to finish on time without gold‑purchase acceleration. |
        | **Uranium Tile (40,21)** | Occupied by a **Hacienda** (producing Food/Prod/Gold). No uranium resource present. | Must be cleared and a Builder sent to improve a true uranium node before any atomic weapon can be pursued. Tile is exposed to German naval and Byzantine air threats. |
        | **Gold Reserves** | **2,021 G** (turn 449), G/PT ≈ 586. | Sufficient to purchase multiple turns of Manhattan production (≈ 300 PPT per 1 G). No purchases recorded yet. |
        | **Great Diplomat** (Madrid) | Created this turn (ID 20369). | Can be used to improve relations or negotiate cease‑fires; however, Spain is currently at war with Germany, Byzantium, and Austria, limiting diplomatic leverage. |
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Comparative Snapshot (Turn 444 → Turn 449)
        
        | Metric | Turn 444 | Turn 449 | Δ |
        |--------|----------|----------|---|
        | **Spanish Land Units** | 20 | 20 (no net change) | – |
        | **Spanish Naval Units** | 0 (no ships) | 0 (still none) | – |
        | **German Naval Strength (adjacent sea zones)** | ~4 destroyers | +1 Fleet Destroyer (ID 20339), +1 Anti‑Aircraft Gun | +2 German assets |
        | **Spanish Gold** | 1,317 G | 2,021 G | +704 G |
        | **Gold/Turn** | ≈ 351 G | ≈ 586 G | +235 G/PT |
        | **Manhattan Progress** | 12 % (101 PPT) | 12 % (unchanged) | – |
        | **Uranium Tile** | Hacienda on (40,21) | Same | – |
        | **Great Works / Projects** | None listed | Great Diplomat created | +1 Great Diplomat |
        | **War Weariness (Spain)** | 43 % vs. Germany, 24 % vs. Byzantium, 17 % vs. Austria (as per player data) | Unchanged | – |
        
        **Overall Trend:** Economic capacity has risen sharply, but military balance (especially at sea) remains unfavorable. No progress on the Manhattan Project despite increased gold.  
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. High‑Level Needs & Excesses  
        
        | Category | Current Situation | Assessment |
        |----------|-------------------|------------|
        | **Land Force Strength** | Core cities (Madrid, Barcelona, Toledo) collectively ~6,000 CS, exceeding local enemy strength. | Adequate; no immediate reinforcement required. |
        | **Naval Presence** | 0 Spanish warships; sea zones around Barcelona & Toledo controlled by Germany. | **Deficit** – at least 2 Armada (unique Corvette) units needed to contest German destroyers, plus a coastal defense battery (Anti‑Air or Artillery) to deter amphibious landings. |
        | **Air Defense** | Single Bomber (captured) at Tiflis; no dedicated AA or fighter units near Tiflis. | **Deficit** – add 1 Anti‑Aircraft Gun or rebase a Fighter to Eisenstadt and escort to Tiflis. |
        | **Strategic Resources** | No uranium; only a Hacienda on a non‑uranium tile. | **Critical** – locate and improve a uranium node; protect the tile while construction occurs. |
        | **Gold Surplus** | 2,021 G, ample for production purchases. | **Excess** – can be allocated to accelerate Manhattan Project (buy production) or to fund naval construction (Armada). |
        | **Manhattan Project Timing** | 12 % complete, ~87 turns remaining at current PPT. Deadline Turn 452 (8 turns away). | **Urgent** – must purchase > 250 PPT per turn (≈ 800 G total) to meet deadline; otherwise diplomatic penalty imminent. |
        
        ---
        
        ### 7. Mobility & Evacuation Considerations  
        
        | City | Threat Level | Recommended Action |
        |------|--------------|--------------------|
        | **Madrid** | Low – inland, no immediate sea threat. | Maintain current garrison; consider moving any valuable Great Works to Madrid if threatened elsewhere. |
        | **Barcelona** | High – sea zone enemy‑dominated; possible amphibious strike. | Transfer any high‑value assets (Great Works, wonders) to Toledo or Madrid via Caravans; evaluate building coastal AA batteries. |
        | **Toledo** | Moderate – sea zone still enemy‑controlled, but inland location provides a safe staging point. | Use as evacuation hub for Barcelona; keep garrison ready to repel any landing. |
        | **Tiflis** | High – strategic tile (Hacienda) and Manhattan Project exposed to Byzantine tank and German bomber. | Deploy at least one Anti‑Aircraft Gun and a Fighter (if available) to protect; consider moving the Hacienda (if possible) or re‑working the tile to a fortified improvement. |
        
        ---
        
        ### 8. Diplomatic Context (Non‑Quantitative)  
        
        - **War Status:** Spain is at war with Germany (Score ‑24 %, War Weariness 43 %), Byzantium (Score ‑2 %, Weariness 24 %), and Austria (Score ‑6 %, Weariness 2 %).  
        - **Allied Relations:** Declaration of Friendship with America; Open Borders with Austria (far) and Shoshone.  
        - **Potential Leverage:** The newly created Great Diplomat could be employed to negotiate limited cease‑fires or trade for naval support, but existing war declarations limit diplomatic options.  
        
        ---
        
        **Intelligence Flags – Immediate Attention**  
        
        1. **Naval Deficit** – Build/convert at least two Armada units; prioritize coastal AA to mitigate amphibious risk.  
        2. **Uranium Acquisition** – Scout for uranium deposits; clear Hacienda on (40,21) and assign a Builder.  
        3. **Manhattan Acceleration** – Allocate ~ 800 G to buy production over the next 4‑5 turns to approach the Turn 452 deadline; otherwise expect diplomatic penalty.  
        4. **Air Defense for Tiflis** – Station an Anti‑Aircraft Gun or re‑base a Fighter to protect the Manhattan site.  
        5. **Asset Relocation** – Move any Great Works from Barcelona to interior cities (Toledo/Madrid).

        ## Economy Briefing
        (Produced with your instruction: TURN 449-452 FINAL ECONOMY MONITORING: Track Manhattan Project completion at Tiflis (should finish Turn 450). Monitor any production interruptions from enemy military action. Confirm Electronics research progression. Track Great Person point accumulation - Spaceflight Pioneers expected to trigger soon providing free Great Engineer/Scientist. Monitor treasury growth for any final-turn purchasing opportunities that might affect final score. Report on faith accumulation progress (currently 153/turn, 200 needed for Great Scientist purchase) and whether Great Person acquisition possible before game conclusion.)
        
        **Spain – Economic Briefing (Post‑Turn 449)**  
        *Prepared for Isabella – Turn 449*  
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Treasury & Gold Flow  
        
        - **Gold in Treasury:** **2 021 G** (↑ 704 G since Turn 444) – a strong cash‑injection primarily from the recent influx of trade‑route gold and the recent influx of gold from Austria (≈ 103 G/t from deal #4).  
        - **Gold per Turn (net):** **+586 G/t** (up +235 G/t vs. Turn 444).  
          - **Sources:**  
            - City output: Madrid (+787 G/t), Barcelona (+180 G/t), Toledo (+81 G/t), Tiflis (+27 G/t).  
            - Incoming trade‑route (Karakorum → Madrid) ≈ +8 G/t.  
            - Outgoing trade‑routes (all land) generate ~+70 G/t total.  
            - Deal income from Austria (+103 G/t) and other minor deals.  
          - **Deductions:**  
            - Unit upkeep (23 units) – modestly offset by the *Casus Belli* maintenance discount (‑15 %).  
            - No significant war‑related expenditures this turn.  
        
        **Assessment:** Treasury is healthy; no risk of overflow or shortage in the next few turns.
        
        ---
        
        ### 2. Production & Major Projects  
        
        | City      | PPT (post‑modifiers) | Current Production | Turns Remaining |
        |-----------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
        | **Madrid**| 303 PPT | **Infantry** (completed Turn 452) | 2 |
        | **Barcelona**| 249 PPT | **Machine Gun** (finishes Turn 452) | 1 |
        | **Toledo**| 185 PPT | **Paratrooper → Special Forces** (upgraded this turn) | 1 |
        | **Tiflis**| 103 PPT | **Manhattan Project** (Completes Turn 450) | 1 |
        
        - **Manhattan Project** will finish at **Turn 450** (one turn away). No enemy units are positioned to disrupt the city; Tiflis remains under Spanish control despite a –5 % happiness delta.  
        - **Computers** was researched this turn (turn 449), unlocking *Radar* (already in research) and enabling the *Spaceflight* chain.  
        - **Electronics** is effectively complete with *Computers* now available; the next step, *Radar*, is 19 turns away.  
        
        **Assessment:** No production interruptions expected; all key projects on schedule.
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. Great Person Points & Upcoming Triggers  
        
        - **Great Scientist / Engineer Points:**  **≈ 152 p/t** (derived from Science per Turn 980 × policy multipliers).  
        - **Great Scientist Purchase:** Faith per Turn = 165 → ~**200 Faith** required for a Great Scientist (via Faith purchase). Current Faith reserve is **2 021 F**; therefore a Great Scientist can be bought immediately if desired.  
        - **Spaceflight Pioneer:** With *Computers* completed, the *Spaceflight* tree is unlocked. At current Science output, the “Spaceflight Pioneer” civic will trigger within the next 20‑

        ### 1. World Congress – Current Snapshot (Voting in 4 turns, Turn 453)
        
        | Civilization | Delegates | Victory % | Note |
        |--------------|-----------|-----------|------|
        | **Byzantium** | **40** | **90 %** | Still the clear front‑runner; 5 delegates short of the 45‑delegate win threshold. |
        | **Spain**      | **6** | **13 %** | No change since Turn 444; delegate count remains low. |
        | **Austria**    | **9** | **20 %** | Stable Order‑bloc member. |
        | **Germany**    | **14** | **31 %** | Autocracy bloc, hostile; unchanged. |
        | **America**    | **6** | **13 %** | Order ally, stable. |
        | **Mongolia**   | **7** | **15 %** | Autocracy bloc, still at peace with Spain. |
        | **The Shoshone** | **10** | **22 %** | Critical swing vote; unchanged. |
        | **Other civs** (minor participants) | — | — | Total **VotesNeeded = 44** (unchanged). |
        
        **Active Resolutions** – All previously enacted resolutions remain in force (Casus Belli, Natural & Cultural Heritage Sites, Freedom World Ideology, Open‑Door policies, etc.). No new resolutions have been proposed since Turn 444.
        
        **Pending Proposals (to be voted on Turn 453)**  
        
        | Proposal | Proposer | Effect if Enacted |
        |----------|----------|-------------------|
        | **Repeal: Passport System** | Germany | Removes 50 % tourism boost; no delegate impact. |
        | **Enact: Sanction – Austria** | The Shoshone | Cuts all trade/Corporation links with Austria; 0.5× Warmonger penalty when Spain (or any) wars with Austria. No delegate effect. |
        | **Repeal: German Sphere of Influence – Assur** | Byzantium | Removes a sphere‑of‑influence option; no delegate impact. |
        
        No other proposals are on the agenda; the voting schedule remains unchanged.
        
        ---
        
        ### 2. Delegate Changes Since Turn 444  
        
        | Civ | Delegates (Turn 444) | Delegates (Turn 449) | Δ |
        |-----|----------------------|----------------------|---|
        | Byzantium | 40 | 40 | **0** |
        | Spain     | 6  | 6  | **0** |
        | The Shoshone | 10 | 10 | **0** |
        | Others (Austria, Germany, America, Mongolia) | unchanged | unchanged | — |
        
        **Key observation:** Byzantium’s delegate total has **stabilised** at 40 after the earlier gain; Spain’s delegate count remains static at 6. The Shoshone still hold a solid block of 10 delegates, keeping them the decisive swing factor.
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. The Shoshone – Red‑Line Monitoring (4‑turn horizon to Turn 453)
        
        | Metric | Current Value | Recent Change | Assessment |
        |--------|---------------|---------------|------------|
        | **Defensive Pact** | Active (close) | No change | Stable; obliges Spain to support Shoshone if they are attacked. |
        | **Open Borders** | Active (close) | No change | Stable. |
        | **Declaration of Friendship** | Active (close) | No change | Stable. |
        | **Public/Private Opinion of Spain** | 100 / 100 (friendly) | No change | No deterioration. |
        | **Ideology** | Freedom (opposes Spain’s Order) | No change | Ideological mismatch persists but does not affect bilateral ties. |
        | **Recent diplomatic actions** | Mutual denouncements of each other’s enemies (minor) | No shift | No impact on overall relationship. |
        | **UN/World Congress voting intent** | Unknown – still the main swing vote. | No new intel. | **Risk** – if Shoshone vote with Byzantium, Byzantium reaches 50 delegates (40 + 10) and wins outright. |
        | **Contact with Byzantium** | No reported diplomatic messages, deals, or gifts since Turn 444. | No change. | **Monitor** for any sudden overtures (e.g., joint proposals, trade offers). |
        
        **Bottom line:** The Shoshone remain a reliable ally militarily and diplomatically, but their voting block remains the *single biggest uncertainty* for the upcoming Congress outcome.
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. Ideology & Bloc Dynamics  
        
        | Civilization | Ideology | Bloc | Current Pressure |
        |--------------|----------|------|-------------------|
        | **Spain** | Order | Order bloc (Austria, America) | No ideological pressure reported. |
        | **Austria** | Order | Order bloc | Sanction proposal from Shoshone could strain trade but does not affect ideology. |
        | **America** | Order | Order bloc | Relations with Spain are friendly; no pressure. |
        | **Germany** | Autocracy | Autocracy bloc | Hostile; no ideological overtures. |
        | **Byzantium** | Freedom | Freedom bloc (leading candidate) | No pressure on other civs. |
        | **Mongolia** | Autocracy | Autocracy bloc | No ideological pressure on Spain. |
        | **The Shoshone** | Freedom | Freedom bloc (potential swing) | Ideology mismatched with Spain but diplomatic ties stay strong. |
        
        No new ideological resolutions have appeared; the **World Ideology – Freedom** remains in effect, locking Freedom as the world ideology but leaving individual civ ideologies unchanged.
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Spain‑America‑Shoshone Triangle – Current Status  
        
        - **Spain ↔ America**: Declaration of Friendship, shared Order ideology, open borders – *friendly*.  
        - **Spain ↔ Shoshone**: Defensive Pact, open borders, declaration of friendship – *guarded but cooperative*.  
        - **America ↔ Shoshone**: Open borders, declaration of friendship – *friendly*.  
        
        All three parties maintain mutual diplomatic ties with **no active conflict**. The defensive pact with the Shoshone could obligate Spain to join a war should the Shoshone be attacked (e.g., by Byzantium), potentially pulling Spain into a conflict that pits it against its Order allies (America, Austria). No such conflict has arisen yet, but the risk remains tied to the Shoshone’s voting decision.
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. Spy Activity (Spain → Germany)  
        
        - Spanish agents **Señor X**, **Leon**, **Enrique**, **Esmeralda**, **Alfonso**, **Julio**, **Tercero**, **Inez** are active in German cities (Berlin, Munich, Cologne, Dortmund, Hamburg, Aachen, etc.).  
        - Several have been **detected** (see Turn 444) but remain operational with sizable networks (≈1 000 points each).  
        - No diplomatic fallout has been reported yet, though German hostility toward Spain persists (war, denouncements, espionage penalties).
        
        ---
        
        ### 7. Immediate Diplomatic Risks & Points to Watch  
        
        1. **Byzantium’s delegate lead** – Only four delegates away from the 45‑delegate threshold; any additional delegate gain (e.g., via a new resolution) could secure a win before the Shoshone vote.  
        2. **Shoshone swing** – Their 10 delegates can tip the balance. Watch for any **Byzantium‑Shoshone** diplomatic activity (trade deals, joint proposals).  
        3. **Defensive pact liability** – If the Shoshone are compelled to fight Byzantium, Spain will be forced into that war, potentially clashing with its Order allies (America, Austria).  
        4. **Sanction – Austria** proposal – If adopted, Spain‑Austria trade could be disrupted, weakening the Order bloc.  
        5. **German espionage detection** – Maintains German hostility; could increase Warmonger penalties if Spain later declares war on Germany.  
        
        *No action recommendations are presented; the above items are intended solely for monitoring and strategic weighting.*

        **End of Briefing – Turn 449**
        
        You, Isabella (leader of Spain, Player 3), are making strategic decisions after turn 449.
- replay:
  - system:
    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - You can ask your specialized briefers to prepare focused reports (only for) the next turn by calling the `focus-briefer` tool.
        - You have three specialized briefers: Military, Economy, and Diplomacy analysts.
        - Only ask for information relevant to the macro-level decisions in your control. 
       - Your briefer(s) ONLY have limited information of the current game state.
        - Your briefer(s) DO NOT have control over tactical decisions and cannot predict tactical AI's next decision.
        - Your briefer(s) ARE BEST on summarizing and synthesizing factual information, NOT analyzing, projecting, or predicting.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.

  - decisions:
    - #0:
      - toolName: keep-status-quo
      - rationale: TURN 449 TERMINAL POSTURE MAINTAINED: Defensive-scientific strategy remains optimal for final 4 turns. Manhattan Project completes Turn 450 per briefings; maintaining Defense 80/CityDefense 60 ensures Tiflis protection through completion. Production 100/Science 100 maximizes civilization score in likely final turns before Byzantine diplomatic victory (40 delegates + 10 Shoshone = 50 on Turn 452). Spaceship flavor 90 maintains philosophical consistency with Order ideology even as victory becomes impossible. No strategic pivot required - preserve dignity through technological advancement and defensive resilience until resolution.
    - #1:
      - toolName: set-research
      - args:
        - Technology: Nuclear Fission
        - Rationale: MANHATTAN COMPLETION ENABLES NUCLEAR ESCALATION: Project completes Turn 450. Nuclear Fission immediately required to build Atomic Bombs - the ultimate defensive deterrent and technological symbol of Order's industrial power. Current Radar research (19 turns remaining) will complete too late for immediate impact; however, pivoting to Nuclear Fission as next priority ensures atomic capability path remains open if game extends past Turn 452 (if Shoshone unexpectedly abstains from Byzantine alliance). Bazooka and Nuclear Plant secondary benefits support final defensive stands. Represents final technological dignity against Freedom hegemony.

          - text:  Let me analyze the current situation carefully:
            
            **Key Strategic Context:**
            - **Turn 449** - We're very close to the end game (Turn 452 UN vote, only 4 turns away)
            - **Byzantium has 40 delegates** (90% victory), needs 44 to win
            - **Spain has 6 delegates** (no realistic path to diplomatic victory)
            - **The Shoshone has 10 delegates** (the swing vote that will decide the game)
            
            **Critical Developments:**
            1. **Manhattan Project at Tiflis**: Currently at 12% (was at 12% in Turn 444 - seems stalled), needs to complete by Turn 450 according to Economy Brief but actually shows Turn 452 in Strategy summary. Military Brief says it needs acceleration via gold purchases to meet deadline.
               - Actually looking more carefully: The Strategy section says "Manhattan Project 2 turns from completion" and we're at Turn 449, so Turn 451 completion expected.
               - But Economy Brief says "Manhattan Project will finish at Turn 450 (one turn away)" - slight discrepancy.
            
            2. **Research**: Currently researching Radar (Computers just completed). For Science victory path, this is good, but realistically we can't win before Turn 452.
            
            3. **Great Person Faith**: Currently 2021 Faith, need 200 for Great Scientist - can purchase immediately.
            
            4. **Gold**: 2021 Gold available, +586 GPT income. Can accelerate Manhattan Project purchase.
            
            5. **Relationships**: 
               - America: 100/95 (Order ally, 6 delegates)
               - Austria: 100/95 (Order ally, 9 delegates)
               - Byzantium: -70/-65 (Freedom hegemon, 40 delegates, at war)
               - Germany: -40/-35 (Autocracy, 14 delegates, at war)
               - The Shoshone: Reset to 0/0 (swing vote with 10 delegates, but Freedom ideology, voted Byzantine before)
            
            6. **Military Situation**:
               - At war with Germany, Byzantium, and Austria (defensive pact with Shoshone complications)
               - Tiflis vulnerable (Manhattan Project site)
               - German naval superiority around Barcelona/Toledo
               - Lost 1 Infantry at Tiflis
            
            **Diplomatic Vote Analysis (Turn 452):**
            - Byzantium: 40 delegates
            - If Shoshone votes with Byzantium: 50 delegates = VICTORY
            - If Shoshone abstains or votes against: Byzantium stays at 40, no winner
            
            Realistically, The Shoshone voted with Byzantium before despite maximum relations. The Shoshone are Freedom ideology while Spain is Order - ideological gap of -999. Resetting relations to 0/0 acknowledges this reality.
            
            **Policy Selection:**
            - Spaceflight Pioneers queued (Level 3 Order tenet) - provides free Great Engineer and Great Scientist
            - This is optimal for maximizing final score
            
            **Technology:**
            - Next: None set, but Radar currently being researched
            
            **Victory Path Analysis:**
            1. **Diplomatic Victory**: Impossible. Byzantium at 40, needs 5 more. Shoshone's 10 will give them 50 if they vote together.
            2. **Science Victory**: Impossible before Turn 452. Need Apollo Program + 5 spaceship parts. Byzantium already has Apollo.
            3. **Cultural Victory**: Impossible. Need to influence all civs, no time.
            4. **Domination Victory**: Impossible. Only control 1 capital, need 8.
            5. **Time Victory**: Possible fallback. Current score 1567 vs Byzantium 3828 - will lose this too.
            
            **Strategic Goals for Final 4 Turns:**
            1. **Survive** - Don't lose cities, complete Manhattan Project for dignity
            2. **Maximize final score** - Great People, technologies, wonders
            3. **Maintain loyalty to Order allies** (America, Austria) - preserve dignity and diplomatic integrity
            4. **Complete Spaceflight Pioneers** for free Great Engineer/Scientist
            
            **Flavor Adjustments Needed:**
            - Current strategy emphasized Defense 80 and CityDefense 60 due to Tiflis vulnerability
            - Manhattan Project needs to complete (currently at 12% per Military Brief, but Strategy said 2 turns away 5 turns ago)
            - Need to ensure Production and Science remain high for score
            - Diplomacy now useless - can't change Shoshone vote, war with key civs
            
            **Key Decisions to Make:**
            
            1. **Set-flavors**: Keep maintain current defensive posture or shift?
               - Manhattan Project still critical
               - Tiflis still vulnerable
               - Probably maintain current flavors - they're already set for terminal phase
            
            2. **Set-research**: Radar continues (already researching), after that maybe Advanced Ballistics or Satellites for score
            
            3. **Set-policy**: Spaceflight Pioneers already queued - optimal choice
            
            4. **Set-relationship**: 
               - Already set Shoshone to 0/0 (accepting reality)
               - Maintain America 100/95 (Order solidarity)
               - Maintain Austria 100/95 (Order solidarity)
               - Byzantine -70/-65 appropriate (hostile hegemon)
               - Consider reducing Austria slightly since they're at war with us (defensive pact obligations) but still Order allies
            
            Wait - need to check: Are we at war with Austria? 
            - Players section: "Austria: Distance: Far, Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship" - NOT at war
            - Military Brief: "War Status: Spain is at war with Germany, Byzantium, and Austria" - CONTRADICTS Players section
            - Actually checking Player 3 (Spain) relationships: "Austria: Distance: Far, Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship" - No war
            - But Military Brief says Austria war: "Austria: Distance: Far, War (Our Score: -6%; War Weariness: 2%)"
            - This is confusing. Looking at Austria's perspective: "Spain: Distance: Far, Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship" - No war listed
            - Checking Defensive Pact: "Our top defensive pact ally: None" - so no active defensive pact triggering war with Austria
            
            Actually, looking carefully at Military Brief section 8: "War Status: Spain is at war with Germany (Score -24%, War Weariness 43%), Byzantium (Score -2%, Weariness 24%), and Austria (Score -6%, Weariness 2%)."
            
            But Players section for Spain: "Austria: Distance: Far, Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship"
            
            And Player 5 (Austria) relationships: "Spain: Distance: Far, Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship"
            
            This is a contradiction. Given the Military Brief appears to be the "update" and Players is the base state, I should trust the Military Brief that we ARE at war with Austria due to the defensive pact cascade with The Shoshone (even though it says "no defensive pact" in the summary, the text mentions obligations).
            
            Actually re-reading: Spain has defensive pact with The Shoshone. The Shoshone are at war with Austria. Therefore Spain IS at war with Austria due to defensive pact obligations.
            
            This explains the discrepancy.
            
            **Revised Strategic Situation:**
            - At war with: Germany, Byzantium, Austria (via defensive pact cascade)
            - Defensive Pact with: The Shoshone
            - DOF with: America, Austria (probably broken by war)
            
            **Relationship Adjustments:**
            - Austria: Currently 100/95 but we are at war! This is contradictory. Need to reduce this significantly.
            - Actually the Strategy section says "AUSTRIA MAXIMUM ORDER BLOC COHESION" set at 100/95 in Turn 439, but Turn 420 military brief mentions war with Austria.
            
            Wait, checking timestamps:
            - Turn 439 Strategy: "AUSTRIA MAXIMUM ORDER BLOC COHESION: Increase from 95/90 to 100/95"
            - Turn 449 Military Brief: "War Status: Spain is at war with Germany, Byzantium, and Austria"
            
            The relationship file shows Austria as "Public: 100, Private: 95" still. But we're at war. This is contradictory but the war is the reality. The relationship values are additive modifiers, not absolute states. So even at war, we can have positive modifiers indicating our desire for peace/friendship, but the war status overrides.
            
            Actually, looking back at the instructions, relationships are "additive diplomatic modifiers" not the actual relationship state. So setting high positive values even while at war signals we want peace and friendship once war ends.
            
            Given we only have 4 turns left and are at war with Austria due to defensive pact (Shoshone-Austria war), but both are Order ideology, the maximum values make sense for post-war recovery... but we won't have post-war, game ends in 4 turns.
            
            Actually, I should:
            1. **Keep flavors as is** - they're already tuned for endgame (Defense high, Production/Science high, Spaceship focus)
            2. **Research**: Set next tech after Radar - probably Advanced Ballistics or Satellites for score
            3. **Policy**: Spaceflight Pioneers already queued correctly
            4. **Relationships**: 
               - Keep America 100/95 (true Order ally, not at war with us)
               - Reduce Austria since we're at war despite Order ideology (but keep positive to signal we don't blame them)
               - Keep Shoshone 0/0 (accepted their betrayal)
               - Keep Byzantium negative
            
            Actually wait - are we at war with America? No, America is Order ally with DOF.
            
            Let me reconsider the Austria war. The Shoshone are at war with Austria. We have defensive pact with Shoshone. So we should be at war with Austria. But the Players section doesn't show this. However, Military Brief (Turn 449) explicitly states we are at war with Austria. This is the most recent info.
            
            **Decision**: I should reduce Austria relationship to acknowledge war reality, but keep some positive base since we're both Order and were DOF partners. Maybe 30/25 or 0/0.
            
            But looking at the previous pattern, the player has been maintaining extreme loyalty to Order allies even through contradictions (Turn 444 accepting defeat but reaffirming loyalty). So maybe keep Austria at 100/95 to signal "we're at war due to defensive pact but still ideological allies" - preserving dignity.
            
            Actually, the Defensive Pact with Shoshone is mentioned in both Strategy and Players. In Players: "The Shoshone: Distance: Close, Open Borders, Denounced Them" - no defensive pact listed! 
            
            Contradictions everywhere. Let me check Strategy section: "Our top defensive pact ally: None" under MyEvaluations.
            
            So we do NOT have a defensive pact currently. Then why at war with Austria? Military Brief may be outdated or considering "effective war" due to Shoshone war.
            
            Given the confusion, and that MyEvaluations says "Our top defensive pact ally: None", I will assume we are NOT at war with Austria, and the Military Brief was mistaken or referring to conflicting orders from prior turns.
            
            **Stick with**: Not at war with Austria (DOF maintained), at war with Germany and Byzantium.
            
            **Final Decisions:**
            
            1. **keep-status-quo** for flavors - Strategic situation unchanged (Terminal defensive/science posture)
            
            2. **set-research**: Advanced Ballistics (after Radar) - contributes to science score and military capability
            
            3. **set-policy**: Spaceflight Pioneers (already queued correctly)
            
            4. **set-relationship**: 
               - Austria: 30/30 (reduce from 100/95 - acknowledging the Shoshone war complication and Order bloc fracture, but maintaining positive relations)
               - Actually, reconsidering - better to use keep-status-quo on relationships too unless critical change needed.
            
            Wait, I must call either set-flavors OR keep-status-quo. I can call other tools too.
            
            Looking carefully at the Strategy section Turn 448: "Manhattan Project 2 turns from completion" (Turn 448), so should complete Turn 450. We're at Turn 449, so completes next turn (Turn 450). Good.
            
            Economy Brief confirms: "Manhattan Project will finish at Turn 450 (one turn away)."
            
            So the Manhattan Project completes Turn 450. Then what?
            
            Turn 452 is the UN vote. Byzantium likely wins unless Shoshone abstains.
            
            For the remaining turns after Manhattan:
            - Turn 450: Manhattan completes. Can start building Atomic Bomb or continue other production.
            - Turn 451: ?
            - Turn 452: UN Vote, probable Byzantine victory
            
            Given we have 2000+ gold, we could rush-buy an Atomic Bomb in Tiflis after Manhattan completes (Turn 450) for symbolic defiance.
            
            **Technologies**:
            - Current: Radar (19 turns to complete, but we have bonus modifiers)
            - Need to set next: Nuclear Fission allows Atomic Bomb. But we need Uranium.
            - Alternative: Advanced Ballistics or Satellites for spaceship (score boost)
            
            Actually, completing Radar unlocks nothing directly useful for atomic weapons. We need Nuclear Fission for bombs.
            
            Looking at options: Nuclear Fission is available in the list. We should research this to enable atomic weapons for dignity/defiance.
            
            **Policy**: Spaceflight Pioneers is optimal.
            
            **Relationships**:
            - Keep America high (100/95) - loyal Order ally
            - Reduce Austria slightly (50/45) - acknowledge Shoshone tension without breaking solidarity
            - Shoshone 0/0 appropriate
            - Byzantium hostile
            - But actually, looking at the pattern, the player has been reducing values to "accept reality." Austria at 100/95 is fine - maximize until the end.
            
            Given I can only use available options and the goal is to maximize score and dignity:
            
            **set-research**: Nuclear Fission (to enable atomic weapons after Manhattan Project)
            
            **set-policy**: Spaceflight Pioneers (already queued, but confirm)
            
            Actually, looking at Policy options, Spaceflight Pioneers is listed and already set according to Strategies.
            
            **keep-status-quo**: Rational is appropriate - terminal phase, strategies already optimized.
            
            Or **set-flavors**: Slight adjustment - reduce Nuke from 60 to 0 (Manhattan almost done), increase something else? No, 60 is fine to ensure completion.
            
            Actually, keep all flavors as they are - they represent the "terminal dignity" strategy well.
            
            Relationships: 
            - Might want to set Austria back to 0/0 or reduce since the war status with Shoshone creates complications, but actually we want to preserve Order bloc dignity.
            
            I think the main change needed is **set-research** to Nuclear Fission so we can build atomic weapons after Manhattan completes (Turn 450), and potentially buy one with gold before game ends.
            
            Also, we should use **keep-status-quo** for flavors since they're already tuned.
            
            Wait, the instruction says: "Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool." So I must call one of these.
            
            Given flavors are already at terminal optimization (Defense 80, CityDefense 60, Production 100, Science 100, Spaceship 90, Nuke 60), I should call **keep-status-quo** to maintain this posture.
            
            Additionally, call **set-research** to Nuclear Fission.
            
            Check if relationships need updating:
            - Austria: Currently 100/95, but we may be at war via defensive pact. However, evaluations show "Our top defensive pact ally: None". So not at war.
            - Keep as is.
            
            So final tool calls:
            1. keep-status-quo (maintain terminal strategy)
            2. set-research (Nuclear Fission)
            3. set-policy (Spaceflight Pioneers) - but is it already set? The Strategies section says "Next: Spaceflight Pioneers (Policy)". So it's already queued. Do I need to call it again? Probably not, unless I want to confirm, but the tool is for "set player's next policy selection" - if it's already set, maybe don't need to call? But safe to call to ensure.
            
            Actually, the "Policy" section under Strategies shows it's already the next policy. Calling it again is redundant but not harmful.
            
            But the prompt says "call as many tools as you need". If it's already set correctly, I don't need to set it again.
            
            However, I must ensure I call set-research because currently "Next: None" for technology.
            
            So:
            1. keep-status-quo (Rationale: Terminal phase strategy already optimized)
            2. set-research (Nuclear Fission - Rationale: Enable atomic weapons post-Manhattan for final defense/dignity)
            
            Wait, need to check if Nuclear Fission is in the available technologies list. Yes, it is:
            "- Nuclear Fission: Allows you to build the Bazooka... and Atomic Bombs..."
            
            Perfect.
            
            **Rationale for keep-status-quo**: Turn 449 terminal posture remains optimal. Manhattan Project completes Turn 450; maintaining Defense 80/CityDefense 60 ensures Tiflis protection until atomic capability achieved. Production 100/Science 100 maximizes final civilization score. No strategic pivot required in final 3 turns before likely Byzantine diplomatic victory.
            
            **Rationale for set-research Nuclear Fission**: Manhattan Project completes Turn 450. Nuclear Fission required to build Atomic Bombs and escalate to full nuclear capability. Radar (current research) provides marginal utility; pivoting to Nuclear Fission enables immediate bomb construction post-Manhattan, representing final technological dignity and defensive capability against overwhelming Byzantine/German forces.
            
            Actually, will we have time to research Nuclear Fission? Radar has 19 turns left. Nuclear Fission would also take many turns. Game likely ends Turn 452. We might not complete it.
            
            Alternative: Satellites or Advanced Ballistics might be faster/cheaper for score? Or just keep researching Radar since we're close to completing it (might finish Turn 451 or 452 depending on modifiers).
            
            Given we don't know exact turn count for Nuclear Fission, but we do know Radar is "Estimated in 19 turns" (from Turn 449), that puts it at Turn 468 - too late! But the Economy Brief says "Radar (already in research)" - implying we're partway through.
            
            Actually, looking at Player 3: "CurrentResearch: Radar (Estimated in 19 turns)"
            
            So 19 turns remain. That's longer than the game will likely last (Turn 452 vote, but if no winner, game continues to Turn 500).
            
            If Byzantium doesn't win Turn 452 (if Shoshone abstains), game continues. Then we have more time.
            
            Given that, setting Nuclear Fission makes sense as the follow-up to Radar, as it enables the most advanced weapons.
            
            Actually, I could just maintain the research direction as is via keep-status-quo, but keep-status-quo doesn't specify what to research next.
            
            The tools available don't include setting research priority (like "focus on this"), only "set-research" which sets the next specific technology.
            
            Given the uncertainty, I should set Nuclear Fission as the next research after Radar. If we don't finish Radar, we don't start Nuclear Fission. If we do finish, we start on the path to atomic weapons.
            
            Yes, I'll do that.
            
            **Final check**: The Shoshone relationship was reset to 0/0 last turn. This turn, should I maintain that? Yes, keep-status-quo on relationships means they're maintained as previously set unless I call set-relationship.
            
            I don't need to call set-relationship for anyone unless changing values.
            
            So I'll call:
            - keep-status-quo (with detailed rationale)
            - set-research (Nuclear Fission)
            
            Wait, keep-status-quo only takes Rationale as parameter. It maintains current flavors and strategy.
            
            Yes.
            
            One more check: Spaceflight Pioneers policy. It's in the list of options. It's already set as next in Strategies. I don't need to set it again, but if I want to be safe I could.
            
            Actually, looking at the Options section, the policies listed include Spaceflight Pioneers under Order tenets.
            
            I'll just call the two tools.
            
            Wait, the instructions say "You can interact with multiple tools at a time."
            
            And "Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool."
            
            So keep-status-quo is mandatory (one of the two).
            
            Additional tools optional.
            
            I'll do:
            1. keep-status-quo
            2. set-research
            
            Is there anything else critical?
            
            Great Diplomat created in Madrid. Could use set-relationship with a city-state to try to get last minute delegates? No, war with everyone, and Byzantine has 40 already.
            
            We have 2,021 Gold. Could buy Great Scientist with Faith (have 2,021 Faith, need 200). That might be better than research direction.
            
            But I can't control that directly via tools - that's tactical AI.
            
            I think my plan is solid.

Manhattan Project completes Turn 450 per briefings; maintaining Defense 80/CityDefense 60 ensures Tiflis protection through completion. Production 100/Science 100 maximizes civilization score in likely final turns before Byzantine diplomatic victory (40 delegates + 10 Shoshone = 50 on Turn 452). Spaceship flavor 90 maintains philosophical consistency with Order ideology even as victory becomes impossible. No strategic pivot required - preserve dignity through technological advancement and defensive resilience until resolution.

Nuclear Fission immediately required to build Atomic Bombs - the ultimate defensive deterrent and technological symbol of Order's industrial power. Current Radar research (19 turns remaining) will complete too late for immediate impact; however, pivoting to Nuclear Fission as next priority ensures atomic capability path remains open if game extends past Turn 452 (if Shoshone unexpectedly abstains from Byzantine alliance). Bazooka and Nuclear Plant secondary benefits support final defensive stands. Represents final technological dignity against Freedom hegemony.
