  - rationale: Turn 452: Critical survival situation - Byzantium at 40/44 delegates with World Congress voting in 1 turn. They just demonstrated nuclear aggression by nuking Madrid. Apollo Program completes next turn - must immediately pivot to maximum spaceship production. Increased Nuke flavor to 100 (from 95) and UseNuke to 95 (from 90) - need immediate nuclear deterrent capability given Byzantine nuclear attack and Mongol peace expiry. Production boosted to 95 (from 90) for rapid spaceship part construction after Apollo completes. GreatPeople to 85 for Great Engineer acquisition. All other priorities secondary to surviving long enough to complete science victory.

  - system:
    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.
        - Time Victory: If no one achieves any other victory by the end of the game, the civilization with the highest score wins.
      - Players: summary reports about visible players in the world.
        - You will receive in-game AI's diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each player's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.
      - Cities: summary reports about discovered cities in the world.
        - Settling cities provides long-term economic advantages, but requires initial investment and pressure on happiness.
      - Military: summary reports about tactical zones and visible units.
        - Tactical zones are analyzed by in-game AI to determine the value, relative strength, and YOUR tactical posture.
        - For each tactical zone, you will see visible units from you and other civilizations.
      - Events: events since the last decision-making.
    - You are Washington, leader of America (Player 2).

        - Neediness: 8
        - Chattiness: 7
        - DeceptiveBias: 3
        - Rationale: Turn 443: Increasing DenounceWillingness from 7 to 8. Peace with Mongolia expires in 1 turn - they have started Manhattan Project and will almost certainly launch nuclear attack. Need to maintain maximum diplomatic pressure through denouncements. Byzantium at 93% of diplomatic victory - must escalate hostile diplomatic stance. WarBias remains 3 despite imminent conflict - still overwhelmingly outnumbered 11:1, must prioritize survival and infrastructure protection over offensive posture.
        
        ## Technology
        - Next: Lasers
        - Rationale: Turn 449: Lasers remains critical next research after Telecommunications completes. Unlocks Globalization and Particle Physics - both essential for Science Victory progression toward spaceship parts. Also provides Nuclear Missiles which may become necessary as deterrent against Byzantine/Mongol aggression. Mobile Tactics would offer Mechanized Infantry but offensive units not priority while defending against existential threats.
        
        ## Policy
        - Next: Spaceflight Pioneers (Policy)
        - Rationale: Turn 449: Spaceflight Pioneers (Order Tier 3 tenet) confirmed as next policy selection in 9 turns. Free Great Engineer and Great Scientist will be essential for rushing spaceship parts after Apollo Program completes in 4 turns. This is the only viable path to Science Victory before Byzantium secures diplomatic victory in upcoming World Congress sessions.
        
        ## Relationships
        
        ### Raqmu
        - Public: 40
        - Private: 40
        - Rationale: Reducing Raqmu from previous high priority to moderate positive relationship. Lost Ally status to Mongolia (39 influence vs our 35), and recovery is complicated by Mongolia's Defensive Pact with hostile Shoshone. While unit-gifting quest offers path to 80+ influence, resources better allocated to time-critical Colombo and Argos quests. Maintaining modest positive values preserves Friends status for potential future opportunity.
        - UpdatedTurn: 192
        
        ### Rio de Janeiro
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Resetting Rio de Janeiro relationship to neutral (0/0). The follower quest ends in 2 turns with me at 33 followers vs the leader's 44 - an 11-follower gap that is mathematically impossible to close. Previous 100/100 priority is now wasted resources. Missionaries should redirect to winnable targets (Argos in 3 turns, Shanghai with 19 turns). Preserve existing Friends status (110 influence) without further investment.
        - UpdatedTurn: 222
        
        ### Shanghai
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Resetting Shanghai from 100/100 to neutral 0/0. Follower quest mathematically failed - 38 follower gap with only 4 turns remaining (69 vs 31). Quest will expire unsuccessfully. My Protected status expired (now -60 influence). Continuing to invest missionaries here is futile against Mongolia's 202 influence. Redirect resources to defendable targets.
        - UpdatedTurn: 236
        
        ### Argos
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Resetting Argos city-state from 100/100 to neutral 0/0. The quest to capture Raqmu is militarily impossible—zone 6611 shows 906 enemy strength vs 108 friendly strength (8:1 ratio). Recent naval losses (Caravel and Galleass destroyed) confirm this assessment. With only 23 turns remaining against Shoshone's superior military (1371 vs 817), abandoning this quest prevents resource waste. Preserve existing 142 influence at Argos without further diplomatic investment.
        - UpdatedTurn: 262
        
        ### Warsaw
        - Public: -70
        - Private: -70
        - Rationale: Setting Warsaw (German city-state puppet) to -70/-70 hostile. Just declared war on me along with German alliance bloc. Germany has overwhelming 576 influence here. Hostile stance appropriate for enemy combatant city-state.
        - UpdatedTurn: 297
        
        ### Kabul
        - Public: -70
        - Private: -70
        - Rationale: Setting Kabul (German city-state puppet) to -70/-70 hostile. Just declared war alongside Germany. German Sphere of Influence enacted here at 410 influence makes this a permanent enemy asset. Treat as hostile target.
        - UpdatedTurn: 297
        
        ### Genoa
        - Public: -70
        - Private: -70
        - Rationale: Setting Genoa (Mongol sphere city-state) to -70/-70 hostile. Declared war with Mongol alliance. Tengriism majority and Mongol influence makes this enemy territory.
        - UpdatedTurn: 297
        
        ### Assur
        - Public: -70
        - Private: -70
        - Rationale: Setting Assur (German city-state puppet) to -70/-70 hostile. Just declared war with German alliance. Germany has 470 influence here as Ally.
        - UpdatedTurn: 297
        
        ### M'banza-Kongo
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Resetting M'banza-Kongo from -30/-30 to neutral 0/0. Current turn 305 data shows this city-state is Neutral with -6 influence, not at war with me. Austria (my ally at 50/50 with Declaration of Friendship) is the Major Ally of M'banza-Kongo at 205 influence. Hostile stance could accidentally trigger attacks on Austrian-aligned units or vice versa. Neutral stance appropriate for Austrian sphere city-state while maintaining defensive focus on actual combatants (Mongolia, Byzantium, Germany, France).

        ### Brussels
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Turn 345: Resetting Brussels from -30/-30 to neutral 0/0. Peace was formally established this turn after their aggressive declaration. Austria maintains overwhelming control here (863 influence as Ally vs Shoshone's 349 as Friends), making Brussels effectively part of my ally's sphere. Neutral stance recognizes peace while avoiding provocation that could drag Austria into unwanted conflicts. Cautious but non-hostile posture appropriate given their recent aggression but current Austrian dominance.

        ### Luba
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Turn 354: Resetting Luba from 60/60 to neutral 0/0. Successfully won religious quest last turn, now Friends with 410 influence (comfortable buffer). Resources should redirect to Colombo religious quest (10 turns remaining) and military defense against Shoshone. No need for further diplomatic investment here.
        - UpdatedTurn: 354
        
        ### Colombo
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Turn 365: Colombo religious quest completed successfully - Protestantism is now majority religion here. Open Door policy prevents permanent Ally status anyway. Reducing from 50/50 to 0/0 as the immediate diplomatic priority is satisfied. Friends status at 193 influence provides sufficient buffer without further investment. Redirect resources to military defense and other priorities.

        ### Manila
        - Public: -70
        - Private: -70
        - Rationale: Turn 387: Setting Manila (German sphere city-state, Player 31) to -70/-70 hostile. Manila declared war on Austria (my essential Order ally) this turn. Austria subsequently made peace, but Manila remains allied with Germany at 70 influence. Treat as enemy combatant city-state.

        ### Sydney
        - Public: -70
        - Private: -70
        - Rationale: Turn 387: Setting Sydney (German sphere city-state, Player 33) to -70/-70 hostile. Sydney also declared war on Austria this turn. Germany has 75 influence as Ally here. Consistent with other German sphere city-state hostilities.

        ### Huari
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Turn 408: Resetting Huari to neutral 0/0 following peace treaty with Byzantium. Third-party peace enacted with this Byzantine sphere city-state for 10 turns. Previous -70/-70 hostility no longer appropriate while peace holds. Neutral stance prevents accidental provocation while maintaining caution.

        ### Shedet
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Turn 408: Resetting Shedet to neutral 0/0 following peace treaty with Byzantium. Third-party peace enacted with this Byzantine sphere city-state for 10 turns. Previous -80/-85 hostility no longer appropriate while peace holds. Neutral stance prevents accidental provocation while maintaining caution.

        ### The Shoshone
        - Public: -100
        - Private: -100
        - Rationale: Turn 418: Maintaining maximum hostility toward The Shoshone. At war, 3,650 military strength, Freedom ideology. Austria is winning against them but they threaten my eastern borders. Peace treaty with Austria reduces my eastern pressure, allowing focus on Mongol threat.
        - UpdatedTurn: 418
        
        ### Germany
        - Public: -100
        - Private: -100
        - Rationale: Turn 418: Germany remains at maximum hostility. They have Defensive Pact with Mongolia, Denunciation, Autocracy ideology, and have made war declarations against my ally Austria. Their German Sphere of Influence proposals passing in World Congress. Maximum hostility consistent with diplomatic stance and military reality.
        - UpdatedTurn: 418
        
        ### Austria
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: Turn 418: Austria remains critical ally at maximum 100/100. They've done peace treaty with Shoshone, reducing my eastern border pressure so I can concentrate against Mongol western threat. Their 8,002 military strength vs German coalition provides essential protective buffer. Shared Order ideology and coordinated war effort must be maintained. Cannot survive without Austrian protection.

        ### France
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: Turn 418: Brazil no longer in game - defeated? Or relationship stale. Removing this entry from consideration.

        ### Spain
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: Turn 426: Spain captured Seville from Germany this turn, joining their capture of Tiflis earlier. They are actively fighting THREE of my enemies (Mongolia, Germany, Byzantium) and succeeding. Their Order ideology alignment, Declaration of Friendship, and combat contributions merit complete trust at 100/100. They are carrying the offensive burden while I defend.
        - UpdatedTurn: 427
        
        ### Mongolia
        - Public: -100
        - Private: -100
        - Rationale: Turn 443: Confirming Mongolia at maximum -100/-100 hostility. Peace treaty expires in 1 turn and they have started Manhattan Project with Uranium available. This is an imminent nuclear threat that demands maximum hostility for proper war planning and defensive preparations. Cannot afford any ambiguity - they will almost certainly declare war and use nuclear weapons against my cities.
        - UpdatedTurn: 443
        
        ### Byzantium
        - Public: -100
        - Private: -100
        - Rationale: Turn 443: Byzantium remains existential threat at 41/45 delegates (93%) with World Congress voting in 10 turns. If they secure 3 more delegates, they win. They have 38,745 military strength vs my 1,982. Maximum hostility maintained. My spies are active in Constantinople for intelligence and counter-operations. Must disrupt their delegate accumulation while racing for science victory.
        - UpdatedTurn: 443
        
        ## Strategy
        - Rationale: Turn 451: Critical juncture - Byzantium at 40/44 delegates (90%) with World Congress voting in 2 turns. They need just 4 more delegates for diplomatic victory. Apollo Program completes in New York in 2 turns. Current strategy optimized for survival and science rush: maximum Defense (100), Science (100), Spaceship (100) with high Production (90) for rapid spaceship part construction after Apollo completes. Maintaining maximum hostility toward all enemies (-100) and alliance with Order ideologues Austria/Spain (100). Cannot prevent Byzantine delegate accumulation diplomatically with only 6 delegates vs their 40 - must hope they fail to reach 44 or beat them to science victory. Lasers research path remains correct for unlocking Particle Physics/Globalization. Spaceflight Pioneers policy in 7 turns essential for Great Engineer rush on spaceship parts. No strategic changes - focus is surviving imminent World Congress vote and preparing for immediate spaceship construction if Byzantium falls short.

        You, Washington (leader of America, Player 2), are making strategic decisions after turn 452.
- replay:
  - system:
    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.
        - Time Victory: If no one achieves any other victory by the end of the game, the civilization with the highest score wins.
      - Players: summary reports about visible players in the world.
        - You will receive in-game AI's diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each player's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.
      - Cities: summary reports about discovered cities in the world.
        - Settling cities provides long-term economic advantages, but requires initial investment and pressure on happiness.
      - Military: summary reports about tactical zones and visible units.
        - Tactical zones are analyzed by in-game AI to determine the value, relative strength, and YOUR tactical posture.
        - For each tactical zone, you will see visible units from you and other civilizations.
      - Events: events since the last decision-making.
    - You are Washington, leader of America (Player 2).

          - Espionage: 90
      - rationale: Turn 452: Byzantium at 40/44 delegates with World Congress voting NEXT TURN. They just NUKED Madrid - demonstrating both nuclear capability and willingness to use it. Apollo Program completes in 1 turn - this is the pivot point. Must immediately shift to maximum spaceship part production after Apollo completes. Maintaining max Defense/Production/Science/Spaceship/Nuke flavors. Reduced some secondary priorities (Naval from 85 to 75, TileImprovement from 50 to 40) to focus resources on immediate spaceship construction and nuclear deterrent. The window is tiny - need to complete spaceship before Byzantium secures 4 more delegates or before they nuke my cities.

      - args:
        - WarBias: 3
        - HostileBias: 7
        - DenounceWillingness: 8
        - Meanness: 8
        - Rationale: Turn 452: Byzantium's nuclear attack on Madrid changes everything. They are now actively using weapons of mass destruction. However, I remain militarily overwhelmed (2,035 vs 42,117 Byzantine strength, 8,905 Mongol). WarBias stays at 3 - cannot initiate offensive wars while so outnumbered and with Apollo completing. HostileBias at 7 and DenounceWillingness at 8 to maintain maximum diplomatic pressure. The nuclear strike demonstrates Byzantine desperation to win before I complete spaceship - they know the race is close.
    - #2:
      - toolName: set-research
      - args:
        - Technology: Lasers
        - Rationale: Turn 452: Maintaining Lasers as next research after Telecommunications. Unlocks Globalization (for more delegates, possibly preventing Byzantine diplomatic victory) and Particle Physics (essential for spaceship). Also provides Nuclear Missiles which are now CRITICAL given Byzantium just used nukes. Need my own deterrent capability immediately.
    - #3:
      - toolName: set-policy
      - args:
        - Policy: Spaceflight Pioneers
        - Rationale: Turn 452: Spaceflight Pioneers remains the essential next policy in 6 turns. The free Great Engineer will rush a spaceship part, and the free Great Scientist provides 100 science per Great Person expended. Given that Apollo Program completes in 1 turn, this Order Tier 3 tenet will be the difference between victory and defeat. No other policy comes close to this value for science victory.

          - text:  Let me analyze the current situation carefully:
            
            **Critical Information:**
            1. **Turn 452** - Just completed my turn
            2. **Byzantium is at 40/44 delegates (90%)** - They need just 4 more delegates for diplomatic victory
            3. **World Congress voting is in 1 turn** - This is the critical moment
            4. **Apollo Program completes in New York in 1 turn** - This is huge! I need to start building spaceship parts immediately
            5. **Spaceflight Pioneers policy in 6 turns** - Will give free Great Engineer and Great Scientist
            
            **Current Military Situation:**
            - The Shoshone: At war, 3,702 military strength (down from previous)
            - Mongolia: Peace expired? They have 8,905 military strength and started Manhattan Project
            - Byzantium: 42,117 military strength - they just NUKED Madrid (Spain's capital)!
            - My military: 2,035 strength - vastly outnumbered
            
            **Key Event - Byzantium Nuked Madrid:**
            - Event #55-79 show Byzantium launched a nuclear missile at Madrid
            - Madrid's population dropped from 37 to 22
            - Massive fallout created on Spanish territory
            - This is an escalation - Byzantium is using nukes
            
            **Diplomatic Situation:**
            - Byzantium at 40 delegates, needs 44
            - I have 6 delegates
            - If Byzantium gets 4 more delegates, they win diplomatically
            
            **Technology:**
            - Currently researching Telecommunications (7 turns remaining)
            - Lasers is set as next research - unlocks Globalization and Particle Physics
            - Apollo Program completes in 1 turn
            
            **Strategy Assessment:**
            1. **Immediate Priority:** Apollo Program completes next turn - I need to start building spaceship parts in every city immediately
            2. **Diplomatic Crisis:** Byzantium is one vote session away from winning. I need to hope they fail to get 44 delegates, or I need to win science first
            3. **Nuclear Threat:** Byzantium has demonstrated willingness to use nukes. I need Strategic Defense Systems and my own nuclear deterrent
            
            
            4. **Military Posture:** The nuclear attack on Madrid signals a dramatic shift - I must rapidly reconfigure my defense strategy to counter potential nuclear strikes
            
            I recognize the need to maintain my current trajectory while intensifying production efforts. The completion of the Apollo Program and securing Spaceflight Pioneers are critical next steps. My diplomatic approach requires careful recalibration - maintaining hostility toward major powers while hoping for a breakthrough in the World Congress voting. The nuclear dimension demands immediate strategic adjustments, particularly in defense capabilities and potential deterrent positioning.
            
            The flavors and grand strategy require subtle recalibration. I'll prioritize defensive capabilities while sustaining momentum toward potential scientific breakthrough, recognizing that a single World Congress session could dramatically alter the geopolitical landscape.
            
            Political relationships remain stable, with existing alignments holding firm. Technological advancement through Lasers research continues as planned, supporting long-term strategic positioning.
            
            Military defensive preparations take precedence, carefully balancing resource allocation between immediate survival and future scientific ambitions.
            
            The Spaceship Grand Strategy remains optimal, focusing on rapid infrastructure development and defensive enhancements. By maximizing production and defense capabilities, I can create a robust foundation for potential scientific breakthrough while mitigating immediate threats from hostile powers.
            
            My diplomatic posture requires nuanced calibration. I'll maintain strong alliances with Austria and Spain, while projecting determined resistance against Mongol and Byzantine expansion. The goal is strategic positioning - scaring potential aggressors without recklessly provoking unnecessary conflicts.
            
            Key tactical priorities include fortifying defenses, accelerating production, and preparing for potential technological breakthroughs that could shift the geopolitical balance.
            
            The critical window is narrow: I have approximately 10-15 turns to achieve a game-changing technological or strategic advantage before facing potential diplomatic defeat. Military vulnerabilities are stark - my current forces are vastly outnumbered by multiple hostile powers, necessitating a calculated approach that maximizes defensive potential while pursuing long-term strategic objectives.
            
            Diplomatically, I'm walking a tightrope. While maintaining overtly hostile public stances toward key adversaries, privately subtle adjustments might buy critical time. The immediate focus is preventing Byzantine victory through any available means - whether scientific breakthrough, covert operations, or alliance manipulation.
            
            The nuclear dimension introduces existential risk. Byzantium's recent attack demands immediate defensive infrastructure upgrades, particularly Strategic Defense Systems deployment across key territories. Simultaneously, I must accelerate nuclear capabilities to establish credible deterrence.
            
            Internal development requires aggressive optimization: maximizing production efficiency, streamlining research pipelines, and positioning for rapid breakthroughs in Lasers technology.
            
            Simultaneously, I'll invest in defensive infrastructure to protect critical assets. The priority is maintaining pressure on hostile powers while building resilience against potential attacks. Nuclear capabilities offer a strategic deterrent, so I'll prioritize developing those systems to complicate enemy calculations.
            
            My approach requires balancing immediate threats with long-term positioning. I'll need to carefully manage diplomatic relationships, potentially moderating some stances to prevent isolation while keeping primary adversaries off-balance. The goal is creating enough friction to slow their momentum without triggering direct confrontation.
            
            The diplomatic landscape remains complex. Multiple potential rally points exist, but I must be pragmatic about my current military limitations. Survival depends on strategic patience and precise resource allocation.
            
            Byzantium's near-victory in delegate count demands immediate attention. I need to disrupt their coalition through targeted diplomatic interventions, potentially leveraging Austria's military strength to create pressure points.
            
            Military positioning requires careful recalibration. I'll maintain defensive readiness while seeking opportunities to advance my strategic objectives. The Spaceship and Science priorities remain non-negotiable, with Production capabilities requiring continued enhancement.
            
            The Delegates system suggests a diplomatic endgame is approaching rapidly. I'll need to make calculated moves in the next few turns to prevent an irreversible Byzantine diplomatic advantage.
            
            Aggressive flavors remain appropriate: Defense, Production, Science, Spaceship, Nuke, and UseNuke will dominate my strategic approach. Military and industrial capabilities must be prioritized to create a credible deterrent and survival mechanism.
            
            The goal is creating just enough friction to prevent immediate defeat while positioning for potential long-term strategic breakthrough. My diplomatic stance reflects this tension - overtly hostile to primary threats, but recognizing the need for tactical flexibility.

              - Espionage: 90
            - Rationale: Turn 452: Byzantium at 40/44 delegates with World Congress voting NEXT TURN. They just NUKED Madrid - demonstrating both nuclear capability and willingness to use it. Apollo Program completes in 1 turn - this is the pivot point. Must immediately shift to maximum spaceship part production after Apollo completes. Maintaining max Defense/Production/Science/Spaceship/Nuke flavors. Reduced some secondary priorities (Naval from 85 to 75, TileImprovement from 50 to 40) to focus resources on immediate spaceship construction and nuclear deterrent. The window is tiny - need to complete spaceship before Byzantium secures 4 more delegates or before they nuke my cities.

            - Rationale: Turn 452: Byzantium's nuclear attack on Madrid changes everything. They are now actively using weapons of mass destruction. However, I remain militarily overwhelmed (2,035 vs 42,117 Byzantine strength, 8,905 Mongol). WarBias stays at 3 - cannot initiate offensive wars while so outnumbered and with Apollo completing. HostileBias at 7 and DenounceWillingness at 8 to maintain maximum diplomatic pressure. The nuclear strike demonstrates Byzantine desperation to win before I complete spaceship - they know the race is close.

            - Rationale: Turn 452: Maintaining Lasers as next research after Telecommunications. Unlocks Globalization (for more delegates, possibly preventing Byzantine diplomatic victory) and Particle Physics (essential for spaceship). Also provides Nuclear Missiles which are now CRITICAL given Byzantium just used nukes. Need my own deterrent capability immediately.

            - Rationale: Turn 452: Spaceflight Pioneers remains the essential next policy in 6 turns. The free Great Engineer will rush a spaceship part, and the free Great Scientist provides 100 science per Great Person expended. Given that Apollo Program completes in 1 turn, this Order Tier 3 tenet will be the difference between victory and defeat. No other policy comes close to this value for science victory.
