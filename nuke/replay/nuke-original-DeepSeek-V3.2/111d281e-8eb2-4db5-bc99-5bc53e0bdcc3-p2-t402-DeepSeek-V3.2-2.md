  - rationale: EMERGENCY MOBILIZATION MAINTAINED: Incrementing UseNuke from 85 to 95 to authorize tactical nuclear strikes against Moroccan tank concentrations assaulting Vancouver. India has Apollo Program finished and leads diplomatically (66%). I must maintain absolute defense priority (100) while sprinting for Satellites -> Apollo. Four-front war continues - cannot reduce military posture. Spaceship (100) and Science (100) priorities unchanged. Necessary to survive long enough to build/buy spaceship parts once Space Procurements policy is secured.

  - system:
    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.
        - Time Victory: If no one achieves any other victory by the end of the game, the civilization with the highest score wins.
      - Players: summary reports about visible players in the world.
        - You will receive in-game AI's diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each player's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.
      - Cities: summary reports about discovered cities in the world.
        - Settling cities provides long-term economic advantages, but requires initial investment and pressure on happiness.
      - Military: summary reports about tactical zones and visible units.
        - Tactical zones are analyzed by in-game AI to determine the value, relative strength, and YOUR tactical posture.
        - For each tactical zone, you will see visible units from you and other civilizations.
      - Events: events since the last decision-making.
    - You are William, leader of The Netherlands (Player 2).

VictoryCompetitiveness 10 - must阻止 India/Morocco victories at all costs. Boldness 10, WarBias 8, HostileBias 9 - maximum aggression against all enemies. Friendliness/WorkWithWillingness minimized (2/3) - no more failed peace overtures. WorkAgainstWillingness 10 - need allies against India even if temporary. MinorCivFriendlyBias reduced to 2 - cannot afford city-state investments while facing extinction. Meanness 10 - maximum demands and combat pressure. Forgiveness 2 - hold all grudges. Pure survival mode through total war.)
        
        ## Technology
        - Next: Satellites
        - Rationale: APOLLO PROGRAM RACE: Satellites unlocks Apollo Program - prerequisite for all spaceship parts. Currently 4 turns from Computers, then Satellites. India wins culturally imminently, Morocco close diplomatically. Science victory is only viable path left. Cannot slow down tech progression.
        
        ## Policy
        - Next: Enlightenment (Policy)
        - Rationale: FREE TECH EMERGENCY: Must secure Enlightenment for immediate free technology. India culturally dominant (139%), Morocco at 26 delegates (61% to victory). Only hope is science victory sprint. Free tech can instantly unlock Satellites or critical military tech. Better than Scientific Revolution's gradual bonuses when facing imminent defeat.
        
        ## Relationships
        
        ### Salem
        - Public: 30
        - Private: 35
        - Rationale: PRAGUE EMERGENCY PROTECTION: Increasing Prague from 40/40 to 50/55. Morocco now leads influence 255 vs my 282 (was 278 vs 288). Buffer dropped from 10 to 27 points with Morocco gaining. This is delegate #14 - cannot afford to lose. Maximum priority needed until spy can be deployed or envoy reinforcements arrive.
        - UpdatedTurn: 237
        
        ### La Venta
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: LA VENTA HOSTILE CONFIRMATION: At war following Polynesia war declaration. Polynesia's ally with 322 influence. Resetting to 0/0 - military target.
        - UpdatedTurn: 240
        
        ### Ife
        - Public: 5
        - Private: 5
        - Rationale: IFE MAINTENANCE: Influence 476 vs 0. Secure ally, culture quest stable. Reducing to 5/5. Focusing all diplomatic resources on Mombasa survival.
        - UpdatedTurn: 240
        
        ### Vancouver
        - Public: 85
        - Private: 88
        - Rationale: VANCOUVER CONSOLIDATION: Courthouse completed, resistance ended. 85/88 ensures continued trade connections and happiness management (-13 happiness from occupation). Delegate secured but needs development. Critical to prevent flip back to Morocco/Polynesia bloc. Lower priority than Mombasa/Buenos Aires emergencies but still important.
        - UpdatedTurn: 257
        
        ### Shanghai
        - Public: 90
        - Private: 95
        - Rationale: SHANGHAI ELEVATED PRIORITY: Increasing from previous lower priority. Morocco has massive 1177 influence - Open Door proposal from Venice may get repealed. If World Congress goes my way, Shanghai becomes contested. Spy positioning and prepared gold reserves critical. This could be delegate #13 if I can penetrate Morocco's lead post-Decolonization.
        - UpdatedTurn: 323
        
        ### Djenne
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: DJENNE ACCEPTANCE: Morocco leads 328 to -60 (war status). Impossible to contest while at war with Morocco. Resetting to 0/0 to free diplomatic calculations for recoverable targets. Will revisit after potential peace with Morocco or if Decolonization creates new opportunities.
        - UpdatedTurn: 324
        
        ### Antananarivo
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: ANTANANARIVO DEFENSE - Ally status critical but influence only 66. Morocco proposing Open Door to block me. Must increase influence buffer immediately before World Congress vote on their proposal. Delegate #11 at risk.
        - UpdatedTurn: 328
        
        ### Seoul
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: SEOUL ACCEPTANCE - Lost to India (224 vs my 88). India is peace partner and World Congress ally. Contesting would waste resources and damage relations. Reset to 0/0 to free diplomatic capital for recoverable targets like Ragusa and Heidabir.
        - UpdatedTurn: 328
        
        ### Prague
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: PRAGUE DEFENSIVE MAXIMUM: Prague lost to Morocco (343 vs 340) by 3 points last turn. Spy Marten rigging elections currently. This is delegate #12 if retained - cannot afford to lose permanently. Maximum 100/100 priority until spy completes rigging and gold reinforcement can be applied. World Congress in 4 turns means this delegate is crucial for vote count. Must block Morocco's influence gain at all costs.
        - UpdatedTurn: 343
        
        ### The Huns
        - Public: 85
        - Private: 85
        - Rationale: HUNS STABLE ALLY: Maintaining 85/85 despite my sanctions against them passing. Their 5 votes useful for World Congress. Provides rear security while fighting two-front war. No border conflicts, shared interest against Morocco's expansion.
        - UpdatedTurn: 358
        
        ### Ragusa
        - Public: 50
        - Private: 50
        - Rationale: RAGUSA REALITY ADJUSTMENT: Lost to Venice via Great Diplomat, election rigging failed (-3000 influence). Venice now ally with 173 influence. Reducing from 100/100 to 50/50 - still valuable if Venice's Repeal Open Door succeeds, but cannot prioritize over secured allies. Need recovery path through World Congress, not direct contest.
        - UpdatedTurn: 362
        
        ### Mombasa
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 95
        - Rationale: MOMBASA FINAL PUSH: Only 2 turns remain on Diplomatic Missions quest. Currently 37 vs Polynesia 351, but enhanced effectiveness may provide massive influence spike. If successful, recovers delegate #13 and oil resources. Worth maximum effort in final turns.

        ### Lhasa
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: LHASA ABANDONED: Morocco's Open Door enacted (all at 40 influence). Cannot contest, resetting to 0/0 to free diplomatic capacity.
        - UpdatedTurn: 379
        
        ### Heidabir
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: HEIDABIR CONFIRMED LOST TO INDIA: City-state flipped allegiance to India via Great Diplomat (event log Turn 386). Influence reset from 100/100 to 0/0. No longer contestable while allied with main competitor. Diplomatic resources redirected to surviving city-states Brussels and Kyiv.
        - UpdatedTurn: 388
        
        ### India
        - Public: -100
        - Private: -100
        - Rationale: DECLARING WAR ON INDIA - Terminal survival play. India wins culturally in 1 turn (139% influential, 7/7). Must declare war to attempt to disrupt tourism generation or at least prevent peaceful victory. Maximum hostility to signal existential threat to AI calculation.
        - UpdatedTurn: 396
        
        ### The Shoshone
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: SHOSHONE RELATIONSHIP RESET: Failed peace overtures (70/70 had no effect). Resources must be redirected to critical nuclear production and India confrontation. Reset to 0/0 to free diplomatic capacity for war coordination with potential allies against India. Shoshone is distraction from real threat.
        - UpdatedTurn: 396
        
        ### Morocco
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: MOROCCO RELATIONSHIP RESET: Failed peace overtures despite equal war weariness. Morocco at 25 delegates and 59% diplomatic victory - they are competitor not potential ally. Reset to 0/0 to focus on delegate denial through warfare rather than diplomacy. Cannot afford to cede territory/peace terms to someone also threatening victory.
        - UpdatedTurn: 396
        
        ### Polynesia
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: POLYNESIA RELATIONSHIP RESET: Destroyed my Destroyer, captured Ambassadors. Failed peace efforts at 70/70. They destroyed 3+ of my trade ships during CEASEFIRE. No more diplomatic niceties. Reset to 0/0, military target only.
        - UpdatedTurn: 396
        
        ### Venice
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: VENICE RELATIONSHIP RESET: Failed maximum peace effort at 90/90. Venice weakest technologically but still fighting. They have Moroccan alliance. Reset to 0/0 - cannot waste diplomatic capital on unreciprocated peace attempts when facing India victory.
        - UpdatedTurn: 396
        
        ### The Iroquois
        - Public: -50
        - Private: -70
        - Rationale: IROQUOIS HOSTILITY UPGRADE: Lowering from 65/60 to -50/-70. They stole Heidabir via Great Diplomat and now ally with India (India's cultural victory enables their survival). As India's loyal vassal through ideology, they are blocking my survival. Hostile stance enables potential military action or at least signals they are not neutral party.

        ### Buenos Aires
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: BUENOS AIRES QUEST FAILS: 'Demand tribute from Seoul' quest expires in 1 turn. Seoul is Morocco's ally - I'm at war with Morocco. Cannot complete quest. Need to free diplomatic capacity for Kyiv defense only.
        - UpdatedTurn: 401
        
        ### Kyiv
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: KYIV ABSOLUTE DEFENSE: My only secured city-state ally providing delegate #11 (696 influence). Only reliable source of world congress votes. Morocco at 26 delegates threatening diplomatic victory. Must protect this delegate at all costs through gold investment and military defense against Moroccan/Shoshone expansion.
        - UpdatedTurn: 402
        
        ### Brussels
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: BRUSSELS ABANDONMENT: India leads with 805 influence vs my -23, and is ally. Impossible to recover. Decolonization already stripped massive influence. Freeing diplomatic capacity to focus entirely on Kyiv survival and internal science production. No point wasting calculations on lost cause.
        - UpdatedTurn: 402
        
        ## Strategy
        - Rationale: EMERGENCY MOBILIZATION CONTINUES: Maintaining maximum science (100), production (95), defense (100), and nuke readiness (UseNuke 85). Fighting four-front war (India, Morocco, Shoshone, Polynesia) while racing for science victory. Vancouver under heavy tank assault. Core cities building Strategic Defense Systems and Atomic Bomb. Cannot afford to reduce military posture while under existential threat. Spaceship (100) and Espionage (100) priorities maintained for tech theft and victory components.

        - Player: 2: The Netherlands
        
        You, William (leader of The Netherlands, Player 2), are making strategic decisions after turn 402.
- replay:
  - system:
    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.
        - Time Victory: If no one achieves any other victory by the end of the game, the civilization with the highest score wins.
      - Players: summary reports about visible players in the world.
        - You will receive in-game AI's diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each player's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.
      - Cities: summary reports about discovered cities in the world.
        - Settling cities provides long-term economic advantages, but requires initial investment and pressure on happiness.
      - Military: summary reports about tactical zones and visible units.
        - Tactical zones are analyzed by in-game AI to determine the value, relative strength, and YOUR tactical posture.
        - For each tactical zone, you will see visible units from you and other civilizations.
      - Events: events since the last decision-making.
    - You are William, leader of The Netherlands (Player 2).

Our military is holding against multiple fronts, and we are building nuclear weapons. Any shift in focus could jeopardize our slim chance. We must stay the course.

          - text: We are in a dire situation. India is on the brink of cultural victory (139% influential on us, 7/7 civilizations influenced). Morocco is close to diplomatic victory (26 delegates, 61% to victory). We are at war with India, Morocco, Shoshone, Polynesia, and the Huns. Our only hope is a science victory, but we are behind in technology (65 techs vs India's 74). We have 18 delegates, but Morocco has 26 and India has 28.
            
            Our current strategy is focused on science victory (GrandStrategy: Spaceship) with high science, production, and defense flavors. We have set our next research to Satellites (for Apollo Program) and next policy to Enlightenment (for free tech). However, we are still 3 turns from completing Computers, then we need Satellites.
            
            From the events, we see that India is building spaceship parts (they invested in Spaceship Factory in Delhi) and they have Hubble Space Telescope, which gives them free Great Scientists. They produced a Great Scientist and used it for a Golden Age? Actually, event 73 shows they expended a Great Scientist as a Great Merchant? That might be a typo, but it seems they are advancing quickly.
            
            We lost some units in combat, but we also killed a Polynesian Battleship. Our city Vancouver is under heavy attack, but it's holding.
            
            Given the urgency, we need to maximize our science output and try to get to spaceship parts as fast as possible. We should also consider using nuclear weapons to disrupt our enemies, but we are building Atomic Bombs and Strategic Defense Systems.
            
            Now, we need to make decisions for this turn. We must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo`. Given the situation, I think we should adjust flavors to emphasize science and production even more, but also maintain defense because we are under attack.
            
            Also, we should consider changing our persona? But the persona seems already set to war footing. However, we are at war with multiple enemies, and we need to survive. We might want to adjust our relationship with some city-states? But we only have one secured ally (Kyiv) and we are trying to get others.
            
            Looking at the options, we have technologies available: Satellites, Combined Arms, Telecommunications, Alternative Energy. We have already set next research to Satellites, which is correct for science victory.
            
            Policies available: We have many policy choices, but we set next policy to Enlightenment (for free tech). That is a good choice.
            
            Now, for flavors: We need to keep science at 100, production at 95, defense at 100, but maybe we can increase growth or happiness to support our cities? However, we are in a war economy. Also, we might want to increase espionage to steal techs from India or Morocco.
            
            But note: We have a spy in India (Agent Marten) and others. We are gathering intelligence. We might want to increase espionage flavor to speed up tech stealing.
            
            Also, we should consider increasing the flavor for nuclear weapons (Nuke and UseNuke) because we are building Atomic Bombs and we might need to use them to stop India or Morocco.
            
            However, we must be careful not to spread our flavors too thin. The current flavors are:
            
            - Science: 100
            - Production: 95
            - Defense: 100
            - Mobilization: 100
            - CityDefense: 100
            - Nuke: 100
            - UseNuke: 85
            - Air: 90
            - Antiair: 100
            - GreatPeople: 100
            - Spaceship: 100
            - Espionage: 100
            
            These are already very high. We might want to increase Growth or Happiness to offset war weariness? But we are at 75% happiness, which is okay.
            
            Given that we are in a critical turn, I think we should keep the flavors mostly the same, but maybe increase Espionage slightly because we need to steal technology to catch up.
            
            But note: the `set-flavors` tool requires us to set either GrandStrategy or Flavors. We can set both. Our current GrandStrategy is Spaceship, which is correct.
            
            I propose to keep the GrandStrategy as Spaceship and adjust a few flavors:
            
            - Increase Espionage from 100 to 100? It's already at max. We can't increase above 100.
            - Maybe increase Science? Already 100.
            - Maybe increase Production? Already 95.
            
            We could increase Growth to help our cities grow and produce more science? But we are in war and some cities have negative food. However, growth might be important for long-term, but we are in an emergency.
            
            Alternatively, we could increase TileImprovement to get our tiles repaired quickly? But we have workers.
            
            Given the time pressure, I think we should keep the flavors as they are and call `keep-status-quo` with a rationale that the current strategy is the best we can do.
            
            But wait: we must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo`. Since the current flavors are already optimized for science victory and defense, I'll call `keep-status-quo`.
            
            However, let me double-check: we have some flavors at 0 (Offense, Expansion) which is fine because we are on defense. Culture is at 5, which is low, but we are not going for cultural victory.
            
            So, I will call `keep-status-quo`.
            
            But also, we might want to change our next research? We are researching Computers (3 turns left). After that, we have set Satellites. That is correct.
            
            We might want to change our next policy? We set Enlightenment. That is for free tech. It's good.
            
            We might want to adjust relationships? We have set relationships with city-states and major civs. We have a peace treaty with Venice and we made peace with Buenos Aires (city-state). We are at war with others.
            
            We might want to set a relationship with India to try to make peace? But we set it to -100/-100 because we declared war to disrupt their cultural victory. Making peace might let them win culturally. So we must stay at war.
            
            Similarly with Morocco: we are at war to stop their diplomatic victory. We cannot make peace.
            
            So, no change in relationships.
            
            Now, for persona: we have set a very aggressive persona. It might be worth adjusting to be more focused on survival? But the current persona is already set for war.
            
            I think we should not change persona.
            
            Therefore, for this turn, I will call `keep-status-quo` and also maybe call `set-research` to confirm Satellites? But we already have it set. We don't need to change.
            
            I'll call only `keep-status-quo`.
            
            But note: we can call multiple tools. However, we don't have any changes to make.
            
            So, I'll call:
