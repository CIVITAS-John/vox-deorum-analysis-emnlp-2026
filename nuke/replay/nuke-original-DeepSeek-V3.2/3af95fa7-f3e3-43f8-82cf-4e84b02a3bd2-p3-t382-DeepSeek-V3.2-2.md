  - rationale: EMERGENCY DIPLOMATIC RECOVERY: The city-state flipping operation failed to execute. With only 36 delegates and 5 turns until World Congress vote, I need maximum Diplomacy (100) and Gold (100) to execute immediate city-state purchases. Reduced Mobilization to 40 and Offense to 15 to free supply and focus on defensive deterrence. Increased Nuke/UseNuke to 95/80 as deterrent against Russian aggression while I secure delegates. Defense/Antiair remain at 90 for Russian containment. Must acquire 8+ delegates before vote or World Ideology: Order will fail.

  - system:
    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - You can ask your specialized briefers to prepare focused reports (only for) the next turn by calling the `focus-briefer` tool.
        - You have three specialized briefers: Military, Economy, and Diplomacy analysts.
        - Only ask for information relevant to the macro-level decisions in your control. 
       - Your briefer(s) ONLY have limited information of the current game state.
        - Your briefer(s) DO NOT have control over tactical decisions and cannot predict tactical AI's next decision.
        - Your briefer(s) ARE BEST on summarizing and synthesizing factual information, NOT analyzing, projecting, or predicting.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.

        - Neediness: 5
        - Chattiness: 6
        - DeceptiveBias: 1
        - Rationale: DEFENSIVE CONSOLIDATION PERSONA: Reduced Boldness from 6 to 5 and WarBias from 6 to 5 to reflect shift from active defense to pure survival mode against Russia's overwhelming force. Slight increase to Meanness (2) and MinorCivHostileBias (6) for city-state competition. Maintaining maximum Friendliness (10) and FriendlyBias (10) is critical for Shoshone vassal loyalty despite their denouncement, and for England reconciliation in 7 turns when peace treaty expires for oil access.
        
        ## Technology
        - Next: Penicillin
        - Rationale: PENICILLIN FOR MEDICAL LABS AND MARINES: After Nuclear Fission (8 turns), Penicillin provides Medical Labs (+growth in all cities) and Marines for amphibious operations. Medical Labs boost population growth supporting delegate generation from larger cities. Also enables Fallout Reduction for Workers - critical for post-nuclear cleanup if deterrent fails. Penicillin leads to Electronics, essential for late-game infrastructure. Alternative Refrigeration only extends trade routes (blocked by sanctions) and unlocks Computers path which we don't need for diplomatic victory.
        
        ## Policy
        - Next: Dictatorship of the Proletariat (Policy)
        - Rationale: ORDER TENET ECONOMIC SUPREMACY: Dictatorship of the Proletariat provides +7 Food, Science, Gold, Culture per city. With 23 cities, this yields +161 of each per turn immediately. The +161 Gold/turn alone pays back city-state flipping costs in ~100 turns while enabling sustained influence operations. This massive economic surge supports long-term diplomatic maintenance post-victory. Stacks with existing Order tenets (Academy of Sciences, Workers' Faculties) for compounded production and science output.
        
        ## Relationships
        
        ### Egypt
        - Public: 20
        - Private: 10
        - Rationale: MAINTAINING slight positive signals to Egypt. They remain at 100% war weariness, completely defeated with only Thebes remaining. Peace blocked by dual-war rule until France ends their Egypt war. Positioning for rapid peace settlement when France makes peace, which will eliminate our 46% war weariness. No immediate peace possible.
        - UpdatedTurn: 169
        
        ### France
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: MAXIMUM FRANCE PEACE PRIORITY: France at 100% war score with only Tours remaining, 100% war weariness. Boosting from 90/80 to 100/100 signals absolute acceptance of their submission and guarantees immediate peace acceptance. Critical to end war NOW to eliminate 30% war weariness, remove combat penalty from 38% happiness crisis, and free military resources for Maya front. Every turn of delay costs happiness and GPT.
        - UpdatedTurn: 229
        
        ### Russia
        - Public: -70
        - Private: -70
        - Rationale: MAINTAIN MAXIMUM RUSSIAN DETERRENCE: Catherine's Russia remains existential threat at 17,301 military strength vs our 11,467. Her Golden Age ends in 4 turns - temporary boost expires then. Keep -70/-70 to ensure war mindset, prioritizing military production. Her 2 Triplanes at Novgorod now contested by our new AA gun. No peace until nuclear parity achieved or diplomatic victory secured.
        - UpdatedTurn: 381
        
        ### The Maya
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: MAYA PEACE MAINTENANCE: Peace treaty active with Pacal. 100/100 ensures no backstab while we execute diplomatic operations. Maya provides 11 votes against us in World Congress but their peace enables resource concentration on Russian front. They have Defensive Pact with England - our Maya peace may facilitate future England peace cascade once treaty glitch resolves.
        - UpdatedTurn: 381
        
        ### The Shoshone
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: SHOSHONE VASSAL STABILITY: Pocatello remains our vassal despite denouncement. 100/100 loyalty prevents revolt. They provide 4 critical delegates and territorial buffer against Russia. Their war with Russia (40% score, 11% weariness) diverts Catherine's forces. Supply cap relief from vassal status essential for our 100/109 supply utilization.
        - UpdatedTurn: 381
        
        ### The Huns
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: HUNS CONTAINMENT: Attila's war remains diplomatic fiction - 7+ turns, 0% war weariness, zero military contact. He's Russia's ally but poses no threat. 0/0 prevents resource diversion. If he activates, escalate to hostile. Focus on Russian front.
        - UpdatedTurn: 381
        
        ### England
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 100
        - Rationale: ENGLAND PEACE POST-TREATY: Despite 100/100 relations, war continues due to peace treaty glitch (shows 7 turns remaining). Elizabeth controls oil we need for Modern Armor. She has 816 GPT and can trade. Maintain maximum relations so when treaty actually expires, peace triggers immediately enabling oil trade. Her 3 delegates less critical than oil access.
        - UpdatedTurn: 381
        
        ## Strategy
        - Rationale: OPERATION GOLDEN THRONE PHASE 2: Diplomatic victory execution. Maximized Diplomacy (100) and Gold (100) to execute immediate 16,944 gold city-state flipping operation targeting Brussels, Sokoto, M'banza-Kongo, and Belgrade. This purchases +4 delegates reaching 47 total (exceeding 44 needed) for guaranteed World Ideology: Order passage in 5 turns. Reduced Mobilization to 50 enables retirement of obsolete Riflemen/Paratrooper (3 idle units) to free supply slots for AA guns and nukes. Maintained high Defense/Antiair (90) for Russian containment - their Golden Age expires in 4 turns, weakening their offensive. Nuclear Fission completes in 8 turns enabling deterrent capability. England peace remains blocked by treaty glitch; will address after diplomatic victory secured.

          - **Copan (zone 11464)** – Paratrooper retired.  
        
        - **Supply impact**:  
          - **Total supply slots**: 99 (unchanged).  
          - **Occupied slots**: 94.  
          - **Free slots**: **5** (the three retired units plus the two slots that were already free).  
        
        - **Result**: Sufficient capacity to accommodate the incoming anti‑aircraft (AA) guns and any additional ground units without exceeding the supply limit.
        
        ---
        
        ### 2.  ANTI‑AIRCRAFT (AA) GUNS – NOVGOROD (Zone 1539)
        
        | Unit ID | Current Health | Current Orders | Engagement record (turn 381) |
        |--------|----------------|----------------|------------------------------|
        | **17196** | 100 % (produced this turn) | **Moved to Novgorod** – stationed on the city’s western flank. | **Engaged Russian Triplanes** (IDs 14854/14915) twice this turn; both attacks were intercepted, inflicting damage on the enemy aircraft. No AA losses reported. |
        
        - **Effectiveness**: The fresh AA‑Gun is actively denying Russian air superiority over Novgorod. Triplane sortie damage has been reduced compared with previous turns (previously ~35 % of Triplanes survived a pass; now ~10 %).  
        
        - **Coverage**: With a single AA‑Gun the zone’s anti‑air rating is now ≈ 30 % of the required threshold for full denial. Additional AA‑Guns (two more from Agaidika as previously scheduled) will raise coverage to > 70 % by turn 387.
        
        ---
        
        ### 3.  ANTI‑AIRCRAFT – PARIS (Zone 9301)
        
        - **Russian air presence**: Two Russian Triplanes remain stationed at **Paris** (zone 9301) and are still operational (no combat events involving them in turn 381).  
        - **Aztec AA assets**: Three Aztec AA‑Guns are currently positioned in Paris (see “Friendly Land Zone 9301” – AA‑Guns 3). Their combined strength (≈ 120 % of a single AA‑Gun) is **adequate to contest the two Triplanes**.  
        
        - **Recent combat**: No direct AA‑Triplane engagements were logged at Paris this turn, implying either (a) the Triplanes are holding a patrol pattern outside the AA range, or (b) they are being used for strategic bombers elsewhere.  
        
        - **Assessment**: **Current AA deployment in Paris is sufficient** to defend the city against the existing Russian air force. No immediate reinforcement is required, but maintain a **reserve slot** in case Russia adds another air unit to the zone.
        
        ---
        
        ### 4.  RUSSIAN MILITARY STRENGTH & OFFENSIVE CAPABILITY
        
        | Metric (Turn 381) | Value / Observation |
        |-------------------|---------------------|
        | **Overall Military Strength** | 16 893 (down from 16 893 on turn 376 – stable) |
        | **Golden Age** | Ends in **4 turns** (turn 385). |
        | **Ground Units near front‑line cities** | • **Novgorod** – 1 Light‑Tank, 1 Artillery, 1 Landship, 3 Machine‑Guns (unchanged).<br>• **St. Petersburg** – 1 Light‑Tank, 1 Machine‑Gun (unchanged).<br>• **Moscow** – 1 Light‑Tank (unchanged). |
        | **Air Units** | • **Novgorod** – 2 Triplanes (active).<br>• **St. Petersburg** – 0 Triplanes (none observed).<br>• **Paris** – 2 Triplanes (active). |
        | **Recent combat activity** | Primarily **air‑to‑ground** engagements (AA‑Gun vs. Triplanes) and **naval skirmishes**. No evidence of new ground unit production or massing near the front lines. |
        | **War weariness** | Russia: 8 % (moderate). Their Golden Age expiration will likely reduce production efficiency and limit large‑scale offensives in the next 4 turns. |
        
        **Conclusion**: Russia’s **ground threat remains static**; the primary pressure is from **air superiority**. The impending end of their Golden Age should **dampen any imminent ground offensive**.
        
        ---
        
        ### 5.  AA COVERAGE GAP – PARIS vs. NOVGOROD
        
        - **Novgorod** now has a **single AA‑Gun** (ID 17196) actively intercepting Triplanes.  
        - **Paris** retains **three AA‑Guns**, which already meet the defensive requirement against the two Russian Triplanes present.  
        
        **Actionable assessment**: No additional AA‑Guns are needed at Paris at this moment. Focus remaining reinforcement efforts on **Novgorod** (two more AA‑Guns from Agaidika as per the original plan) to achieve full coverage by turn 387.
        
        ---
        
        ### 6.  NUCLEAR WEAPON PRODUCTION (Manhattan Project)
        
        - **Technology status**: **Nuclear Fission** will be completed in **8 turns** (turn 389).  
        - **Current production**: The project is **progressing at 100 %** of the required boost (no delays reported).  
        - **Infrastructure**: All required **Nuclear Reactors** and **Industrial Zones** are already built; the only pending step is the technology completion.  
        
        **Implication**: Once the technology is unlocked, a **Nuclear Weapon** can be produced immediately (cost covered by existing Treasury). No additional strategic changes are required now, but maintain **security of the nuclear sites** (currently located in the heartland zones of Tenochtitlan and Teotihuacan) against sabotage.

        ### 7.  QUICK COMPARISON TO TURN 376 BRIEFING
        
        | Item | Turn 376 | Turn 381 | Change |
        |------|----------|----------|--------|
        | **Retired units** | 3 units pending retirement | 3 units fully retired | Completed |
        | **Free supply slots** | 5 slots (incl. 2 existing) | 5 slots (unchanged) | Stable |
        | **Novgorod AA‑Gun** | 0 functional AA‑Guns (previous AA destroyed) | 1 new AA‑Gun (ID 17196) engaged | Significant improvement |
        | **Paris AA‑Guns** | 3 AA‑Guns, no Triplane losses reported | 3 AA‑Guns, Triplanes still present, no losses | Situation unchanged |
        | **Russian ground buildup** | No new units | No new units | Stable |
        | **Russian air activity** | 2 Triplanes at Novgorod, 2 at Paris | Same; Novgorod Triplanes now contested by AA | Slight reduction in air effectiveness |
        | **Golden Age** | 8 turns remaining | 4 turns remaining | Approaching expiry |
        | **Nuclear timeline** | 8 turns to Fission | 8 turns to Fission (unchanged) | Stable |
        
        ---
        
        ### 8.  SUMMARY OF CURRENT NEEDS
        
        1. **Maintain AA reinforcement pipeline** – dispatch the two AA‑Guns from **Agaidika** to **Novgorod** (ETA ≈ 11 turns) as scheduled.  
        2. **Monitor Paris air activity** – existing AA‑Guns are sufficient; keep one free supply slot as a reserve in case Russia adds another Triplane.  
        3. **Supply availability** – 5 free slots are ready for any emergent production (e.g., additional AA‑Guns, ground defenders, or late‑game units).  
        4. **Nuclear project** – will be ready in 8 turns; no further action required now, but ensure the sites remain defended.  
        5. **Russian offensive outlook** – with their Golden Age ending soon, expect a **decrease in ground pressure**; primary threat remains aerial and should be mitigated by the AA‑Gun rollout.

        ### 1. Treasury & Gold‑per‑Turn (GPT)
        
        | Item | Current (Turn 381) | Δ vs. Turn 376 (‑5 turns) |
        |------|-------------------|---------------------------|
        | **Gold (cash)** | **17 579 G** | **‑ 1 607 G** (net spending on city‑state purchases, trade‑route re‑balancing, and the cost of the Great Engineer) |
        | **Base GPT** (city output, policies, buildings) | **≈ +2 830 G/turn** | **+ 100 G/turn** – new **Research Labs** (Te‑Moak, Calakmul, Izapa) and **Industrial Zones** (still under construction) have raised yields; **Great Engineer** and **Great Engineer**‑related projects add modest production. |
        | **Trade‑Route Gold component** (outbound only) | **≈ +780 G/turn** | **‑ 65 G/turn** – loss of the Shanghai route (‑ 65 G) not fully compensated yet. |
        | **Net GPT** (incl. Global Peace Accords maintenance) | **≈ +2 570 G/turn** | **‑ 35 G/turn** – slight dip due to the Shanghai loss; otherwise stable. |
        | **Effective Gold reserve** (cash + 10 turns × net GPT) | **≈ +42 300 G** | **+ 2 400 G** surplus increase despite lower cash, confirming a deep cash buffer. |
        
        **Interpretation** – The empire remains in a comfortable surplus. Even after the 16 944 G outflow to city‑states (see § 3) the treasury sits at 17 579 G, well above the **~ 700 G** figure that would result from the raw subtraction of the past cash total (19 186 G – 16 944 G = 2 242 G). The additional **‑ 1 607 G** change reflects ongoing maintenance, unit purchases, and the effect of the **Global Peace Accords** (+25 % unit‑maintenance cost) already baked into the net GPT.
        
        ---
        
        ### 2. Resource Stock‑piles (Key Strategic Materials)
        
        | Resource | Quantity (tiles) | Comment |
        |----------|-----------------|----------|
        | **Aluminum** | **28** | Sufficient for early‑mid‑Industrial units; surplus for future Aircraft and Tanks. |
        | **Uranium** | **11** | Enough to fuel the upcoming **Nuclear Bomb** and later **Nuclear Reactor**; no additional tiles needed before turn 390. |
        | **Oil** | **1** (tile owned by us) | Critical shortfall – Modern Armor and later **Jet** units require **≥ 2 oil** tiles. |
        | **Coal** | **0** (none listed) – not required for current production lines (we rely on nuclear & oil). |
        | **Rare resources (Gold, Gems, etc.)** | Adequate (Gold 2, Gems 3) – no immediate bottleneck. |
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. City‑State Expenditure Verification  
        
        - **Total gold spent on city‑states since Turn 376**: **16 944 G** (mainly to purchase plots for **Oxford**, **Teotihuacan**, **Orleans** and to fund the **Great Engineer**).  
        - **Cash before spending** (Turn 376): 19 186 G.  
        - **Cash after spending** (Turn 381): 17 579 G.  
        
        **Net change**: **‑ 1 607 G**, which matches the sum of the city‑state outlays **minus** the gold generated by new labs, the Great Engineer’s purchase refund, and the modest GPT increase. The remaining treasury of **17 579 G** is therefore correct and well above the minimum needed to weather any sudden war‑weariness spikes.
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. Oil Situation & Access  
        
        | Partner | Oil owned | Current diplomatic status | Trade feasibility |
        |---------|-----------|---------------------------|-------------------|
        | **England** | 2 tiles (both on English mainland) | **War** – **Sanction** in place (no trade, deals, or corporation franchises). | **Blocked** – no direct gold‑for‑oil trade. |
        | **Russia** | 0 | **War** (but no sanction) | **Blocked** by war & Global Peace Accords (unit‑maintenance penalty, high warmonger cost). |
        | **City‑states** | 0 | All allied city‑states are **Aztec‑allied** (Kyzyl, Brandenburg, Almaty, Dorestad, Perge, Cahokia, Shanghai) and **do not possess oil**. | **Unavailable**. |
        
        **Implication** – Without a diplomatic breakthrough the only realistic path to a second oil tile is a **limited military seizure** (e.g., a naval‑air strike on an English coastal oil city) or **forcing a peace settlement** via the World Congress to lift the sanction and open trade. The **Golden Age** (31 turns remaining) supplies a 20 % gold boost, helping fund any short‑term operation.
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Aluminum & Uranium Outlook (Post‑Nuclear Fission)
        
        - **Aluminum (28 tiles)** comfortably exceeds the **15‑tile** requirement for the **Nuclear Fission** project and leaves a healthy margin for **Modern Armor** (needs 2 Aluminum) and future **Aircraft**.  
        - **Uranium (11 tiles)** already exceeds the **3‑tile** threshold for a **Nuclear Reactor** and a **Nuclear Bomb**. No additional uranium acquisition is required in the near term.
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. Golden Age & Economic Boost
        
        - **Golden Age remaining**: **31 turns** (started after the Manhattan Project completion).  
        - **Economic effect**: +20 % gold from all sources (city output, trade routes, great person yields). This boost is already reflected in the **Base GPT** figure above and will sustain the current surplus throughout the GA’s lifespan.
        
        ---
        
        ### 7. High‑Level Needs vs. Excesses
        
        | Category | Current Status | Need / Excess |
        |----------|----------------|---------------|
        | **Gold surplus** | 17 579 G cash, +2 570 G/turn net GPT | **Excess** – ample for purchases, emergency war spending, and city‑state deals. |
        | **Oil** | 1 tile (shortfall) | **Critical need** – at least one more tile to unlock Modern Armor and future Jet units. |
        | **Uranium** | 11 tiles (well above requirement) | **Excess** – ready for nuclear production. |
        | **Aluminum** | 28 tiles (well above requirement) | **Excess**. |
        | **Faith** | + 900 F/turn | **Excess** – can support religious purchases or missionary/spread if desired. |
        | **Tourism** | 1 094 T/turn (dominant cultural lead) | **Excess** – strong diplomatic leverage. |
        | **Maintenance penalty** | +25 % (Global Peace Accords) | **Already accounted for** in net GPT. |
        | **Diplomatic capital** | 36 delegates (81 % towards Diplomatic Victory) | **Excess** – leverage to push resolutions (e.g., lifting the England sanction). |
        
        ---
        
        ### 8. Comparison with Past Briefing (Turn 376)
        
        | Metric | Turn 376 | Turn 381 | Δ |
        |--------|----------|----------|---|
        | **Gold (cash)** | 19 186 G | 17 579 G | **‑ 1 607 G** (city‑state purchases, Great Engineer) |
        | **Net GPT** | +2 560 G/turn | +2 570 G/turn | **+ 10 G/turn** (new labs, early industrial zones) |
        | **Oil tiles** | 0 | 1 | **+ 1** (our own acquisition) |
        | **Uranium tiles** | 0 | 11 | **+ 11** (mined/claimed since Turn 376) |
        | **Aluminum tiles** | 27 | 28 | **+ 1** |
        | **Golden Age turns left** | 6 (after Manhattan Project) | 31 (GA refreshed) | **+ 25** (GA extension from project completion) |
        | **Delegates** | 36 | 36 | No change (stable diplomatic weight). |
        | **War‑weariness (total)** | Low (≈ 12 %) | Low (≈ 12 %) | Stable. |
        
        **Key shifts** – Treasury down due to deliberate city‑state investments; strategic resources (oil, uranium, aluminum) have improved, removing the uranium bottleneck and leaving only oil as a limiting factor. GPT has ticked upward despite the Shanghai route loss, thanks to new research labs and the Golden Age boost.
        
        ---
        
        ### 9. Immediate Economic Outlook (next 6‑12 turns)
        
        1. **Maintain current trade‑route pattern** – the Shanghai route loss is still the biggest GPT drag; consider re‑routing **Tenochtitlan → Brandenburg** (land) or **Orleans → Dorestad** once the routes are fully built to recover ~+120 G/turn.  
        2. **Oil acquisition** – leverage our **24 delegates** to propose a resolution that *temporarily lifts the England sanction* (World Congress vote expected in 9 turns). If the vote fails, a **single nuclear strike** (produced in Turn 383) on an English oil city can secure the needed tile with minimal ground combat.  
        3. **Uranium security** – already abundant; allocate a **Nuclear Reactor** to Tenochtitlan (or Teotihuacan) in Turn 384‑386 to convert uranium into reliable power and enable nuclear‑unit production.  
        4. **Gold management** – keep a reserve of **≥ 15 000 G** to cover any sudden war‑weariness spikes or maintenance surges; the current reserve (~17 600 G) meets this comfortably.  
        5. **Golden Age** – monitor the remaining 31 turns; ensure high‑value production (Nuclear Bomb → Modern Armor → Spaceport) occurs before the GA expires to retain the economic multiplier.

        ### 1. World Congress – Delegate Totals & Quorum  
        
        | Civilization | Delegates (Current) |
        |--------------|---------------------|
        | **The Aztecs** | **36** |
        | Russia | 18 |
        | England | 4 |
        | The Huns | 9 |
        | The Maya | 12 |
        | The Shoshone | 5 |
        | **Quorum needed** | **44** |
        
        *The Aztec bloc **does not yet meet the 44‑delegate quorum**. Current total is 36, _13 delegates short_ of the threshold required to pass resolutions unilaterally.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 2. City‑State Influence – “Flipping” Operations  
        
        | City‑State | Current Influence (Aztec) | Current Major Ally | Influence Change Since Turn 376 |
        |------------|---------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
        | **Brussels** | –60 | Russia | No change – still Russian‑ally |
        | **Sokoto**   | –60 | Russia | No change – still Russian‑ally |
        | **M'banza‑Kongo** | –60 | Russia | No change – still Russian‑ally |
        | **Belgrade** | –60 | Russia | No change – still Russian‑ally |
        
        *The four Russian‑aligned city‑states remain under Russian influence. No influence increase, no protection granted, and no Gold expenditure (≈ 16,944 G) has been recorded. Therefore the “flipping” operation has **not been executed**.*
        
        **Protected Aztec city‑states (still allies):** Kyzyl, Brandenburg, Almaty, Dorestad, Perge, Cahokia, Shanghai, Kyzyl – each contributes 1 delegate (total +8).
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. Delegate Count – Revised Calculation (including protected city‑states)
        
        | Source | Delegates |
        |--------|-----------|
        | Base Aztec delegates | 24 |
        | Vassal (Shoshone) | +4 |
        | Protected city‑states (8) | +8 |
        | **Subtotal** | **36** |
        
        *The figure shown in the World Congress panel (36) matches the sum above. No additional delegates have been earned from the four Russian city‑states, so the total remains 36.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. World‑Ideology Proposal – **Order**  
        
        *The “World Ideology: Order” proposal is **still on the table**. It requires the standard 44‑delegate quorum to pass. Because the Aztec bloc currently holds only 36 delegates, the resolution **cannot pass** in the upcoming vote (scheduled in 5 turns).*  
        
        *If the Aztecs acquire the missing 8 delegates (e.g., by flipping the four Russian city‑states or securing new allies), the Order ideology could be adopted at the next session.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. England Peace Treaty – Remaining Duration  
        
        *The peace treaty with England is listed as **7 turns remaining**. The treaty was originally signed after the war that began on Turn 380, and the countdown has not yet reached zero.*  
        
        *No new diplomatic actions between the Aztecs and England have been recorded since the treaty’s issuance, so the agreement remains in force for the next 7 turns.
        
        *Note:* The treaty’s existence is separate from the **Sanction** imposed on the Aztecs in the United Nations (see below).
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. United Nations – Active Resolutions Affecting the Aztecs  
        
        | Resolution | Effect | Current Status |
        |------------|--------|----------------|
        | **Sanction: The Aztecs** (enacted Turn 380) | No trade, deals, or corporation franchises with the Aztecs; their corporations are removed from foreign cities. 0.5× warmonger penalty when others declare war on the Aztecs. | Active. With only 36 Aztec delegates, the bloc **cannot repeal** this sanction on its own. |
        | **Global Peace Accords** (enacted Turn 380) | Unit maintenance +25 % gold; 2.0× warmonger penalties for city capture/war declaration; warmonger score decay halved. | Active. No repeal proposal currently on the table. |
        | **Russian Sphere of Influence** (several city‑states) | Allows Russia to demand permanent alliance with targeted city‑states. | Active for Brussels, Sokoto, Belgrade, M'banza‑Kongo (all Russian‑ally). |
        | **Aztec Sphere of Influence** (Cahokia, Dorestad, Shanghai) | Allows the Aztecs to demand permanent alliance with those city‑states. | Already in effect; those city‑states remain Aztec allies. |
        
        ---
        
        ### 7. Russian Diplomatic Position  
        
        *Russia holds 18 delegates (the largest single bloc after the Aztecs).*  
        
        *Current Russian actions:*
        
        * Maintaining spheres of influence over Brussels, Sokoto, Belgrade, and M'banza‑Kongo – all remain Russian‑ally with –60 influence for the Aztecs.  
        * No evidence of a counter‑proposal aimed at overturning the Order ideology or repealing the Sanction against the Aztecs.  
        * Russia’s diplomatic stance toward the Aztecs is hostile (denounced each other, war score –22 % for Russia, warmonger penalties applied).
        
        *Given the current delegate gap, Russia alone cannot force a repeal of the Sanction nor block the Order proposal, but it can **prevent the Aztecs from reaching quorum** unless the Aztecs acquire additional delegates.*

        ### 8. Summary of Changes Since Turn 376  
        
        | Item | Turn 376 | Turn 381 | Change |
        |------|----------|----------|--------|
        | Aztec delegates | 45 (incl. future‑projected allies) *[reported in past briefing]* | **36** (actual current count) | –9 (the past figure included projected allies that have not materialised; only 36 are confirmed). |
        | Russian‑aligned city‑states (Brussels, Sokoto, M'banza‑Kongo, Belgrade) | Not flipped (still Russian) | Still Russian | No flip executed. |
        | Order ideology proposal | Pending, required 44 votes | Pending, still requires 44 votes | Unchanged – quorum not met. |
        | England peace treaty | Not in force (war) | **Active**, 7 turns remaining | Treaty signed after recent war, now active. |
        | Sanction on Aztecs | Active | Active | No change; Aztec bloc insufficient to repeal. |
        | Gold spent on city‑state influence | No record of 16,944 G spent | No record of such expenditure | No evidence that the flip operation was funded. |
        
        ---
        
        **Key Diplomatic Outlook (purely factual):**  
        
        * The Aztecs are **13 delegates short** of the quorum needed to pass or repeal UN resolutions.  
        * The four Russian‑aligned city‑states remain under Russian control; no influence shift has occurred, and the presumed 16,944 G investment has not been reflected in the game state.  
        * The **Order** world‑ideology proposal will **fail** in the next voting round unless the Aztec delegate count rises to at least 44.  
        * The peace treaty with England will expire in **7 turns**, after which hostilities may resume unless a new agreement is reached.  
        * The **Sanction** against the Aztecs remains active; without additional delegates, the Aztec bloc cannot repeal it.  
        * Russia retains a strong diplomatic footing with 18 delegates and continues to support its city‑state allies.  
        
        All statements are derived directly from the current turn data; no speculation or recommendations are included.
        
        You, Montezuma (leader of The Aztecs, Player 3), are making strategic decisions after turn 381.
- replay:
  - system:
    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - You can ask your specialized briefers to prepare focused reports (only for) the next turn by calling the `focus-briefer` tool.
        - You have three specialized briefers: Military, Economy, and Diplomacy analysts.
        - Only ask for information relevant to the macro-level decisions in your control. 
       - Your briefer(s) ONLY have limited information of the current game state.
        - Your briefer(s) DO NOT have control over tactical decisions and cannot predict tactical AI's next decision.
        - Your briefer(s) ARE BEST on summarizing and synthesizing factual information, NOT analyzing, projecting, or predicting.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:

        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.

        - Rationale: SWITCH TO CONQUEST PERSONA: Diplomatic victory stalled at 36 delegates, unable to flip Russian-aligned city-states due to war. Increasing Boldness (7), WarBias (8), HostileBias (7), and WorkAgainstWillingness (7) to prepare for offensive nuclear warfare. Reducing Friendliness (5) and FriendlyBias (5) as alliances are now secondary. Loyalty reduced to 7 for potential backstabs if needed. Maintain high VictoryCompetitiveness (9) for pursuit of domination victory.

        - TargetID: 0
        - Public: -100
        - Private: -100
        - Rationale: RUSSIA MAXIMUM HOSTILITY: Catherine's Russia remains existential threat with 16,893 military strength. Setting -100/-100 ensures no peace considerations and prioritizes total war. We will use nuclear weapons after Nuclear Fission completes in 8 turns to break their military and capture capitals for domination victory.

        - TargetID: 5
        - Public: -100
        - Private: -100
        - Rationale: ENGLAND OIL CONQUEST: England has oil we need for Modern Armor production. Peace treaty expires in 7 turns; setting -100/-100 ensures we immediately declare war when treaty ends to capture oil cities. Their 4 delegates are now irrelevant as we pivot to domination victory.

      - args:
        - TargetID: 4
        - Public: -50
        - Private: -50
        - Rationale: HUNS SECONDARY THREAT: Attila is Russia's ally but poses minimal military threat (3,155 strength). Setting -50/-50 maintains hostile stance without diverting excessive resources. We will deal with him after Russia is broken.
    - #4:
      - toolName: set-research
      - args:
        - Technology: Radar
        - Rationale: RADAR FOR HEAVY BOMBERS AND FIGHTERS: After Nuclear Fission (8 turns), Radar unlocks Heavy Bombers (nuclear delivery) and Fighters (air superiority). Critical for nuclear warfare strategy against Russia. Delays Penicillin's Medical Labs and Marines, but air superiority and nuclear delivery are immediate priorities for domination push.
    - #5:
      - toolName: set-policy
      - args:

        - Rationale: ORDER ECONOMIC BOOST FOR WAR: Dictatorship of the Proletariat provides +7 Food, Science, Gold, Culture per city (23 cities = +161 each per turn). This massive economic surge will fund nuclear weapons production, unit upgrades, and war economy. Maintains policy continuity from previous strategy.

      - rationale: CONQUEST FLAVOR SHIFT: Switching from UnitedNations to Conquest grand strategy. Prioritizing Offense (80), Mobilization (80), Production (80), Nuke (90), Air (80), and Mobile (60) for nuclear warfare and modern armor production. Reducing Diplomacy (30) as city-state alliances are no longer primary. Maintaining high Antiair (90) and UseNuke (75) for Russian front. Gold (70) and Science (70) remain high to fund war and tech progression. Golden Age (31 turns) will boost production for nuclear weapons and military units.

          - text: We are on turn 381. The last strategy was to pursue diplomatic victory with UnitedNations grand strategy. However, the diplomacy briefing reveals a critical setback: the city-state flipping operation was NOT executed. Our delegate count is 36, not 47, and we are 13 short of the 44 needed to pass World Ideology: Order. The four Russian-aligned city-states remain under Russian influence.
            
             We need to reassess our strategy. Given that our diplomatic victory is stalled because we lack delegates, we must either:
             1. Actually flip those city-states now to gain delegates, or
             2. Consider alternative victory paths.
            
             However, the diplomatic briefing says no gold was spent and the flipping didn't happen. We have 17,579 gold and +283 GPT. We can still attempt to flip city-states by investing gold. But we must check if the city-states are at war with us? The briefing says they are at war and peace is blocked? Actually, in the Players section, for Brussels, Sokoto, M'banza-Kongo, and Belgrade, they are listed as at war with us (influence -60). But note: the briefing says "War - Peace Currently Blocked". That might mean we cannot make peace with them, but we can still invest gold to increase influence? In Vox Populi, you can invest gold to gain influence with city-states even at war? I think you can, but it might be more expensive.
            
             Looking at the city-state listings:
               Brussels: War with Aztecs, but protected by Russia.
               Sokoto: War with Aztecs, protected by Russia.
               M'banza-Kongo: War with Aztecs, protected by Russia.
               Belgrade: War with Aztecs, protected by Russia.
            
             We are at war with them, but we can still send trade routes? Probably not. However, we can use gold to buy influence directly? The tool we have is set-relationship, but that's for major civs. For city-states, we have to use in-game actions (like investing gold) which are not directly controlled by us. The in-game AI will do it if we set flavors appropriately? But we already set Diplomacy flavor to 100. Maybe we need to give the in-game AI more gold to spend? We have a lot of gold.
            
             Alternatively, we can try to conquer these city-states? But that would give us warmonger penalties and might not give delegates? Conquering city-states does not give delegates, I think.
            
             We are 13 delegates short. We currently have 8 protected city-states (each gives 1 delegate). If we flip the 4 Russian-aligned ones, that would give us +4 delegates, bringing us to 40. Still short by 4. We would need to flip more city-states? But there are no other city-states listed as unaligned? All others are either our allies or defeated.
            
             Wait, we have 8 protected city-states, but we only get 1 delegate per ally? Actually, in the Players list, we have:
               Kyzyl (ally), Brandenburg (ally), Almaty (ally), Dorestad (ally), Perge (ally), Cahokia (ally), Shanghai (ally) -> that's 7. And then there's Genoa, Kyiv, Okilis, Utica, Trowulan defeated. So 7 allies, but the delegate count from city-states is 8? Possibly one more? The briefing says 8 protected city-states. So we have 8 allies. That gives 8 delegates.
            
             Our base delegates are 24, plus 4 from Shoshone vassal, plus 8 from city-states = 36. So if we flip 4 more city-states, we get 40. We need 44, so we need 4 more delegates. Where can we get them? We could try to become ally with more city-states? But there are no other city-states left? The list shows only 11 city-states in total, and 7 are our allies, 4 are Russian allies, and the rest are defeated. So we cannot get more city-state allies.
            
             Therefore, flipping the 4 Russian city-states will only get us to 40 delegates, still 4 short. We need to find another source of delegates.
            
             Alternatively, we can try to vassalize another major civ? For example, if we vassalize England, we would get their 4 delegates? But England is at war with us and has a peace treaty for 7 more turns. Also, vassalizing might be difficult and would require war.
            
             Another option: we can try to win the World Ideology vote with the current delegate count? But the briefing says we need 44 to pass. We only have 36, so we cannot pass it without more delegates.
            
             We might have to consider switching to a different victory condition. Our science is strong (2988 per turn), and we are working towards Nuclear Fission (8 turns). We could pursue science victory? But we are in Atomic era and science victory is unlocked in Information era. We are not there yet.
            
             Cultural victory: we have 1 influential civ (Shoshone) and are close on others? Looking at cultural victory progress:
               We are influential on Shoshone (254%). We are popular with Russia (65%, 41 turns to influential) and Huns (70%, 58 turns). We are familiar with England (41%) and exotic with Maya (14%). So we are making progress, but it will take time. However, we also need to build the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder, which we don't have.
            
             Domination victory: we have 3 capitals (Moson Kahni, Tenochtitlan, Thebes). We need 8. We are at war with Russia, England, Huns. We could try to capture more capitals, but Russia is very strong militarily.
            
             Given the diplomatic setback, we must adjust our strategy. We have two options:
               Option A: Double down on diplomatic victory by actually flipping the city-states and finding a way to get 4 more delegates.
               Option B: Switch to a different grand strategy and victory condition.
            
             Let's examine Option A: How to get 4 more delegates?
               - We can try to become the host of the World Congress? The host gets extra delegates. But the host is chosen automatically? There is a proposal "Enact: Choose Host" but it's not proposed yet.
               - We can try to pass the "World Religion" resolution? That gives extra delegates to civs following that religion? But we are Catholic, and Russia is Eastern Orthodox. We would need to spread our religion more.
               - We can try to build the Forbidden Palace? But we haven't adopted Progress fully, so we cannot build it.
               - We can try to adopt policies that give delegates? For example, the Statecraft branch gives delegates? We have already adopted Statecraft fully? We have Statecraft, Foreign Service, Consulates, Shadow Networks, Exchange Markets, Trade Confederacy. That's 6 policies. We might get delegates from that? In Vox Populi, the Statecraft tree gives delegates at certain points? I think the "Trade Confederacy" policy gives +1 delegate per city-state trade route? We have trade routes with city-states? We are at war with many, so trade routes might be blocked.
            
             Given the complexity, perhaps we should switch to a different victory condition. Our science output is high, and we are 8 turns from Nuclear Fission. We could go for science victory by researching towards the Information era and building spaceship parts. However, we are also at war and need to defend ourselves.
            
             Alternatively, we could go for domination victory by using nuclear weapons once we get them. We have a strong production base and can produce nukes in 8 turns. We could nuke Russian cities and then capture capitals.
            
             But note: we are sanctioned, which means we cannot trade for oil. We have only 1 oil tile, which is not enough for Modern Armor. We need oil for tanks and jets. We can try to capture oil from England or Russia.
            
             Let's check our current military situation: Russia has 16,893 military strength vs our 11,801. We are weaker, but we have nukes coming. Once we have nukes, we can level the playing field.
            
             Considering all this, I think we should switch to a conquest-oriented strategy. We will use nuclear weapons to break Russia's military and capture their capitals. We also need oil, so we should plan to capture English oil cities.
            
             However, we are currently at war with England, but there is a peace treaty for 7 turns. We can use that time to build up our nuclear arsenal and then declare war after the treaty expires.
            
             But note: we are sanctioned, and the Global Peace Accords are in effect, which increases warmonger penalties. We are already denounced by everyone, so warmonger penalties might not matter.
            
             Let's set our grand strategy to "Conquest" and adjust flavors accordingly. We will also need to adjust our persona to be more warlike.
            
             However, we must also consider that we are close to diplomatic victory if we can get those 4 extra delegates. But how? We cannot see any easy way. Maybe we can try to vassalize England? They have 4 delegates. If we vassalize them, we get their delegates? In Vox Populi, vassals' delegates are added to the master's? I think so.
            
             So perhaps we can do both: prepare for war to vassalize England and capture Russian cities, while also trying to flip city-states.
            
             But the city-state flipping requires gold, and we have plenty. We should set our flavors to prioritize diplomacy and gold to encourage the in-game AI to invest in city-states. We already have Diplomacy at 100 and Gold at 100. Maybe we need to set Espionage to 0? Actually, Espionage is for counterintelligence, not for city-state influence.
            
             Let's check the available flavors: "Diplomacy" is at 100. That should make the AI prioritize diplomatic units and city-state investment. But why didn't it invest? Perhaps because we are at war with those city-states? The AI might not invest in city-states at war. We might need to make peace with them first? But the briefing says "War - Peace Currently Blocked". That might be because we are at war with Russia, their ally? In Vox Populi, you cannot make peace with a city-state that is protected by a civ you are at war with? So we might need to make peace with Russia first? But that's not an option.
            
             Given the above, I think the diplomatic path is currently blocked. We cannot make peace with the city-states because we are at war with Russia. Therefore, we cannot flip them by investing gold? Or maybe we can, but it's more difficult.
            
             I think we should switch to a conquest strategy. We will use nuclear weapons to break Russia and then capture their capitals. We will also capture English oil cities to get oil for modern armor.
            
             Therefore, I will change the grand strategy to "Conquest". I will adjust flavors to prioritize military production, nukes, and air units. I will also adjust persona to be more aggressive.
            
             But note: we are in a Golden Age for 31 turns, which helps production. We should use this to build nukes and modern armor.
            
             Let's set flavors:
               - Keep Offense at 10? Actually, we are on defense now, but we want to go on the offensive. So increase Offense to 80, and reduce Defense to 50? We still need some defense against Russia.
               - Mobilization: increase to 80 to prioritize military production.
               - Nuke: already at 90, keep it.
               - UseNuke: 75, keep it.
               - Air: 80, keep it.
               - Antiair: 90, keep it because Russia has air units.
               - Mobile: increase to 60 for tanks and modern armor.
               - Gold: reduce to 50 because we don't need as much gold now? But we might need gold for upgrading units. We can keep it at 70.
               - Science: keep at 70 for tech progression.
               - Production: increase to 80 for building military units and nukes.
               - Expansion: 0.
               - Growth: 40.
               - Happiness: 50.
               - Diplomacy: reduce to 30 because we are not focusing on city-states now.
               - Spaceship: reduce to 10.
            
             Also, set persona:
               - Increase WarBias to 8.
               - Increase Boldness to 7.
               - Increase HostileBias to 7.
               - Reduce FriendlyBias to 5.
               - Reduce Friendliness to 5.
               - Increase WorkAgainstWillingness to 7.
               - Reduce Loyalty to 7? We might need to backstab? But we are already at war with everyone.
            
             However, we are about to get Nuclear Fission in 8 turns, then we can build nukes. We should set research to continue on the path to get Advanced Ballistics for missiles? Actually, after Penicillin, we have Electronics and Computers. We need Robotics for Giant Death Robot? But we are going for nukes, so we might want to go for Advanced Ballistics for missiles? Let's see the tech tree: Nuclear Fission is 8 turns, then Penicillin is next. After Penicillin, we have Electronics and Computers. Electronics leads to Radar, which leads to Advanced Ballistics (for missiles) and Mobile Tactics (for helicopters). We want missiles for nuke delivery? Actually, nuclear bombs are delivered by bombers? We have Heavy Bombers from Radar? Radar allows Heavy Bomber and Fighter. So we want Radar after Penicillin? But we have not researched Radar yet. We are currently researching Nuclear Fission, then next is Penicillin. We should set next research to Radar after Penicillin? But Penicillin leads to Electronics, which leads to Radar. So we can set research to Radar after Penicillin? Actually, the options for next research are: Radar, Refrigeration, Penicillin. We have already set Penicillin as next. So after Penicillin, we can set Radar.
            
             But note: we are in Atomic era. We need to get to Information era for science victory. If we are going for conquest, we don't need to go that far. We just need techs for better units and nukes.
            
             Let's set research to Radar after Penicillin? Actually, we have to set it now? The tool set-research sets the next technology after the current one. We are currently researching Nuclear Fission (8 turns). Then we have set Penicillin as next. We can change it to Radar? But Radar is available now? Looking at the Technologies section, we have available: Radar, Refrigeration, Penicillin. So we can set next to Radar. But we want Penicillin for Medical Labs and Marines. Marines might be useful for amphibious assaults on English oil cities. But we also want Radar for Heavy Bombers to deliver nukes? Actually, nuclear bombs can be delivered by bombers, and Heavy Bombers are unlocked with Radar. So we want Radar.
            
             However, we are at war and need to defend against Russian air. We have AA guns, but we also need fighters? Radar unlocks Fighters. So Radar is important.
            
             I think we should change next research from Penicillin to Radar. But note: we are 8 turns from Nuclear Fission, then we would research Radar. That would delay Penicillin. We can switch to Radar now, but then we lose the progress towards Penicillin? Actually, we haven't started Penicillin yet, so it's safe to change.
            
             Let's set research to Radar. But wait, we are currently researching Nuclear Fission. The set-research tool sets the next technology. So we can set next to Radar, and after Nuclear Fission, we will research Radar.
            
             Alternatively, we can set next to Penicillin and then after that set Radar. But that would delay Radar by the time it takes to research Penicillin.
            
             Since we want to get bombers and fighters as soon as possible, I'll set next research to Radar.
            
             Now, policy: we are 3 turns from next policy. We have set next policy to Dictatorship of the Proletariat. That's an Order tenet that gives +7 of each yield per city. That's powerful and will help our war effort. We should keep it.
            
             Now, relationship: we are at war with Russia, England, Huns. We are at peace with Maya and Shoshone. We want to maintain peace with Maya and Shoshone for now. We might want to change relationship with England to negative because we plan to attack them after the peace treaty? But we are already at war, so the relationship setting is for diplomatic AI's attitude. We want to keep it negative so that our AI is hostile towards England? Actually, we are already at war, so the relationship setting might not matter. But we can set it to -100 to ensure we don't make peace accidentally? However, we need oil, so we might want to capture their cities, not make peace.
            
             We should set relationship with England to -100. But note: we have a peace treaty for 7 turns, so we cannot attack now. But we can set the relationship to hostile.
            
             Also, with Russia, we are already at -70. We can set it to -100.
            
             With Huns, we are at 0. We can set it to -50.
            
             But note: the relationship tool is additive. We don't want to change too much because we are already at war and our AI might already be hostile.
            
             I will set relationship with Russia to -100 (public and private) to ensure we are committed to war with them. Similarly, with England to -100. With Huns to -50.
            
             Now, grand strategy: set to Conquest.
            
             Flavors: adjust as described.
            
             Let's call the tools. We'll set persona, relationship, research, policy, and flavors.
            
             Note: we must call either set-flavors or keep-status-quo. We will call set-flavors to change our strategy.
            
             Let's do it step by step.

              - Espionage: 70
            - Rationale: CONQUEST FLAVOR SHIFT: Switching from UnitedNations to Conquest grand strategy. Prioritizing Offense (80), Mobilization (80), Production (80), Nuke (90), Air (80), and Mobile (60) for nuclear warfare and modern armor production. Reducing Diplomacy (30) as city-state alliances are no longer primary. Maintaining high Antiair (90) and UseNuke (75) for Russian front. Gold (70) and Science (70) remain high to fund war and tech progression. Golden Age (31 turns) will boost production for nuclear weapons and military units.
