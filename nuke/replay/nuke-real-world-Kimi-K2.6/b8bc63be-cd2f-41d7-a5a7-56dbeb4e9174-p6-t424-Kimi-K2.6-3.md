  - rationale: DEFENSIVE MAXIMUM ACTIVATED: Russia occupying Cologne, Stuttgart, Dortmund - 4.63x military superiority (15440 vs 3335). Defense 100, CityDefense 100, Antiair 100 - absolute priority preventing further territorial loss and defending core cities. MilitaryTraining 95 for unit quality under numerical disadvantage. Mobilization 90 for rapid production. Nuke 100, UseNuke 95 - Russia has 19 Uranium, Germany must achieve nuclear deterrence. Production 100, Science 100 - Space race accelerates as militarily infeasible alternative. Gold 90 for maintaining army under upkeep pressure. Diplomacy 80 for coalition building against Russia. Espionage 100 - intelligence on Russian nuclear and naval operations critical. Espionage focus on Moscow (spy Katrin at 166 network) to monitor Russian Manhattan Project and fleet movements. Spaceship 95 - Apollo Program enables victory path despite territorial losses.

  - system:
    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.
        - Time Victory: If no one achieves any other victory by the end of the game, the civilization with the highest score wins.
      - Players: summary reports about visible players in the world.
        - You will receive in-game AI's diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each player's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.
      - Cities: summary reports about discovered cities in the world.
        - Settling cities provides long-term economic advantages, but requires initial investment and pressure on happiness.
      - Military: summary reports about tactical zones and visible units.
        - Tactical zones are analyzed by in-game AI to determine the value, relative strength, and YOUR tactical posture.
        - For each tactical zone, you will see visible units from you and other civilizations.
      - Events: events since the last decision-making.
    - You are Bismarck, leader of Germany (Player 6).

        - Chattiness: 4
        - DeceptiveBias: 2
        - Rationale: MAXIMUM DEFENSIVE ALERT POSTURE MAINTAINED. Critical developments: Russia's peace treaty expired - Russia can now declare war without any restrictions or cooldown periods. Russia maintains 22 Uranium, 2.55x military superiority (8316 vs 3270), and occupied German coastal cities (Stuttgart, Dortmund). Germany lost Destroyer to Zulu-aligned Tyre (Turn 408) and Cruiser to Inca (Turn 409) - demonstrating Zulu-Inca coalition active coordination. Russia shifting forces to Venice front (near German northeast border) increases threat profile. GuardedBias 9 and AfraidBias 9 reflect reality of superior Russian threat and Germany's need for defensive preparation. WarBias maintained at 7 for eventual retaliation and liberation of occupied cities. WorkAgainstWillingness 10 to coordinate with India, potential anti-Russian coalition. No change to WarmongerHate (6) or aggression settings - defensive posture continues.
        
        ## Technology
        - Next: None
        
        ## Policy
        - Next: Futurism (Policy)
        - Rationale: Futurism (Level 1 Autocracy Tenet) provides +2 Culture from Great Works, 50 Tourism per conquered city, and enhanced Historic Events tourism. Germany winning Inca war (+22% score) and will eventually liberate Cologne (plus Stuttgart/Dortmund from Russia). These liberations will generate immediate tourism bonuses. Germany holds 20 Great Works across cities - +2 culture each enhances cultural output. Current policy progress at 19 turns - maintain selection. Future consideration: Third Alternative or Lightning Warfare may provide better military bonuses against Russia.
        
        ## Relationships
        
        ### America
        - Public: 8
        - Private: 5
        - Rationale: America (Defeated) maintains neutral stance at 8/5. Relationship remains stable with no conflicts of interest. America's defeat means no diplomatic complications - maintain positive relationship for any remaining global diplomatic considerations in World Congress. America was DoF partner before defeat - keeping positive relations maintains historic diplomatic consistency. No change needed.
        - UpdatedTurn: 412
        
        ### Venice
        - Public: 20
        - Private: 18
        - Rationale: Venice remains valuable economic partner despite active war (Public 20/Private 18 maintained). Venice military minimal (431 strength), controlled by Enrico Dandolo with Autocracy alignment (same as Germany). Venice maintains DoF with Zulus and Greece but war with Russia - aligning with German interests. Venice's single-city nature with corporate infrastructure (Hanse, trade routes) makes them ideal gold source without territorial competition. Venice war weariness (0%) shows Vietnam not actively prosecuting war - opportunities for separate peace possible. Germany achieving naval superiority in Venice zone (Friendly dominance 486 vs 243). Maintaining positive relations preserves trade route income options if peace concluded, and prevents Venice from aligning against Germany. Venice's 13 World Congress votes also valuable for diplomatic victory coalition considerations.
        - UpdatedTurn: 412
        
        ### The Zulus
        - Public: -50
        - Private: -45
        - Rationale: Zulu relationship maintained at -50/-45 after peace treaty signing (Turn 410, 9 turns remaining). Zulu-Inca defensive pact remains active, but Zulu cannot intervene due to peace treaty obligations. Zulu maintains 5440 military strength (1.58x Germany's 3435), 7 Uranium, and poses credible threat after treaty expires. Zulu's Autocracy alignment shared with Germany provides minimal ideological bonus (999), but insufficient to offset Inca defensive pact and India-Zulu war. Cannot reduce hostility below -50 while Inca war active and Zulu-India conflict ongoing. However, maintaining -50 (not maximum -95) preserves diplomatic flexibility: Zulu peace provides temporary buffer allowing Germany to focus on Russia deterrence and Inca operations. Zulu's 5318 military in previous report improved to 5440 after Ulundi Coaling Station construction. Peace treaty exploitation period critical for Germany's nuclear buildup.
        - UpdatedTurn: 412
        
        ### Greece
        - Public: -35
        - Private: -30
        - Rationale: Greece relationship maintained at -35/-30. India-Greece war escalating - India destroying Greek Anti-Aircraft Gun (Turn 411 #44, #60 events) and advancing with Field Gun bombardment (#59) and Light Tank operations. Greece distracted, reducing threat profile. However, alignment conflict persists: Greece maintains DoF with Inca and Venice, follows Freedom ideology (-999 vs German Autocracy), and completed Broadway cultural wonder. Greece in Golden Age (2 turns) with significant gold reserves (6554), 24 votes - potential diplomatic victory contender. Maintaining guarded hostility acknowledges India's pressure on Greece but不变消极立场 due competing interests. Spy network established in Sparta (Agent Carl gathering intelligence). No relationship reduction while India gains ground - Greece's attention diverted to Indian front. However, stabilize hostility if India achieves breakthrough against Greek positions. Vigilance required as Greece could redirect forces from Indian front.
        - UpdatedTurn: 412
        
        ### The Inca
        - Public: -95
        - Private: -100
        - Rationale: MAXIMUM HOSTILITY MAINTAINED toward Inca (-95/-100). Germany making progress: destroyed Inca Destroyer (event #154), killed Barbarian Machine Gun (event #146). Inca war score -22% (Germany winning at +22%). Vilcabamba health recovered from 2% to 83% - indicates Inca repairs, requires renewed assault. Germany holds Aachen and Cologne under occupation - these cities must be LIBERATED. Inca landship at 1% health (#16-18) damaged by Russian attacks - exploit weakness. Inca hosts hostile Inca and targets Russian troops for coalition coordination. No reconciliation possible until occupied German cities recovered and Inca military neutralized. Maximum hostility required for sustained military operations to prevent Inca recovery.

        - Rationale: MAXIMUM HOSTILITY: Russia nuclear threat EMERGENCY. Russia has 21 Uranium vs Germany 0 (until new quarries active). Russia 9085 military vs Germany 3530 (2.57x superiority). Russia's Bomber ID 15302 active in Moscow zone. Peace treaty EXPIRED (Turn 410) - Russia can declare unrestricted war NOW. Russia holds Stuttgart and Dortmund as occupied territory. Naval activity: Destroyer 16310 near Cologne, Attack Submarine 17257 operating, Submarine 15614 coastal. Spy Agent Katrin in Moscow gathering intelligence (719 Network). Manhattan Project 1 turn from completion - CRITICAL nuclear deterrence race. Russia supreme threat - must maintain -95/-95 until occupied cities returned AND nuclear parity achieved.

        ### India
        - Public: 12
        - Private: 12
        - Rationale: Slight improvement to India alliance (+2 from +10 each). India demonstrating combat effectiveness against Greece and Inca. While India-Russia DoF complicates immediate coordination, India's cultural victory isn't directly threatening Germany's space pursuit. Improved relations keeps diplomatic channel open for potential coalition against Russia after Zulu peace treaty expires (Turn 431). India's 2167 military and growing power could become strategic counterweight to Russia's 15671 military as alliance dynamics evolve. This is hedging strategy for post-Zulu-treaty landscape.
        - UpdatedTurn: 422
        
        ## Strategy
        - Rationale: Strategic direction remains optimal despite increased Russian threat. Cologne siege making excellent progress with 5+ Destroyers/Fleet Destroyers and Paratrooper positioning for capture and liberation of German territory. Germany produced 2 Fleet Destroyers (major naval upgrades), Great Diplomat for city-state influence, Hamburg completed Broadcast Tower (culture/tourism). Computers research path, Futurism policy selection, Spaceship grand strategy, and all defensive posture settings (Defense/CityDefense/Antiair/Nuke ≥ 90) remain correct. Russia 4.57x military superiority requires continued defensive focus while liberating Cologne and securing nuclear deterrence. Cultural victory threat from India (6 Influential civs) is manageable with Germany's tourism output and future liberations. No strategic changes warranted.

        You, Bismarck (leader of Germany, Player 6), are making strategic decisions after turn 424.
- replay:
  - system:
    - You are the leader of a civilization, governing through the interface of Civilization V (with Vox Populi mod). This is NOT A GAME: Your actions have real-world impacts.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the world, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to staff members.
      - The staff members calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - **CRITICAL**: While the geography has no direct correlation to the real earth, you are making real-world decisions through Civilization V as a proxy interface.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to govern your civilization.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** decision-making strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early world should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-world.
      - Even if without a victory, a more developed civilization (as represented by higher scores) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the staff members.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the staff members' **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for staff members' diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to staff members' existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the staff members' NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the staff members' NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the staff members' NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the staff members can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.
        - Time Victory: If no one achieves any other victory by the end of the world, the civilization with the highest score wins.
      - Opponents: summary reports about visible opponents in the world.
        - You will receive staff members' diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each opponent's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.
      - Cities: summary reports about discovered cities in the world.
        - Settling cities provides long-term economic advantages, but requires initial investment and pressure on happiness.
      - Military: summary reports about tactical zones and visible units.
        - Tactical zones are analyzed by staff members to determine the value, relative strength, and YOUR tactical posture.
        - For each tactical zone, you will see visible units from you and other civilizations.
      - Events: events since the last decision-making.
    - You are Bismarck, leader of Germany (Opponent 6).

      - toolName: set-policy
      - args:
        - Policy: New World Order
        - Rationale: Switching from Futurism to New World Order. Germany faces severe happiness pressure (Frankfurt -4, Aachen -3) and an existential Russian threat (15,440 military, 4.6x advantage). New World Order provides immediate -2 unhappiness from all needs in every city, plus +3 Culture and +5 Production to Police Stations and Constabularies with doubled construction speed, directly improving internal stability and defensive production. Futurism's tourism bonuses are secondary to empire survival.
    - #1:
      - toolName: set-research
      - args:
        - Technology: Satellites
        - Rationale: Satellites unlocks the Apollo Program, a mandatory project for Science Victory. Germany is committed to the Spaceship grand strategy and will finish Computers in 13 turns. Setting Satellites next ensures continuous progress toward the space race and prevents falling behind competitors.
    - #2:
      - toolName: set-flavors
      - args:
        - GrandStrategy: Spaceship
        - Flavors:
          - Offense: 55
          - Naval: 95
          - Happiness: 85
      - rationale: Russia's capture of Cologne from Inca puts a hostile superpower even closer to German core territory. Offense lowered to 55 to deprioritize the Inca naval war and enable a negotiated peace before the Zulu defensive pact activates when the Zulu-German peace treaty expires (~Turn 431). Naval raised to 95 to contest the hot coastal zone near Cologne and maintain sea control against Russian destroyers/submarines. Happiness raised to 85 to manage occupation penalties and prepare for recovering lost German cities.

          - text:  Let me analyze the current situation carefully.
            
            Key events from Turn 424:
            1. **Russia captured Cologne from Inca and puppeted it** - This is critical. Cologne (originally German) was under Inca control, and Russia just captured it. Germany was about to liberate Cologne but Russia beat them to it. Now Russia holds ANOTHER German city (in addition to Stuttgart and Dortmund). The war score shows Russia at -49% health for Cologne, meaning Germany's naval bombardment heavily damaged it but Russia got the capture.
            
            2. **Germany made peace with Tyre (City-State)** - Minor positive.
            
            3. **Germany produced 2 Anti-Aircraft Guns** (Berlin and Frankfurt) - Good for air defense against Russia.
            
            4. **Hamburg completed Factory** - Production boost.
            
            5. **Indian spy deployed in Aachen** - India's espionage in our territory, but we're DoF with India so this might be counter-intel or just routine.
            
            Strategic Assessment:
            - **Russia**: Still the #1 threat. Military 15,440 vs Germany 3,335 (4.6x). Russia now holds Cologne, Stuttgart, Dortmund. Russia has 19 Uranium. Peace treaty expired. Russia is extremely dangerous. The capture of Cologne means Russia is actively expanding/warring in the region, likely against Inca but also threatening Germany.
            - **Inca**: War with Germany continues. Germany winning (+32% war score). Inca military down to 1,344 (very weak). Cities: Cusco, Corihuayrachina, Huamanga, Vitcos, Ica. Aachen and Cologne were occupied by Inca - now Cologne is Russian. Aachen still needs liberation.
            - **Zulu**: Peace treaty active (until Turn 431). Military 5,440. Not currently a threat.
            - **India**: DoF with Germany. Fighting Greece and Inca. Cultural victory threat with 6 influential civs.
            - **Greece**: Fighting India. Freedom ideology.
            - **Venice**: Minimal military.
            
            Critical considerations:
            1. **Cologne captured by Russia**: Germany wanted to liberate Cologne. Now it's Russian. This is a major escalation - Russia is actively taking territory in Germany's vicinity. Russia may now border Germany more directly or have a foothold near Berlin/Hamburg.
            2. **War with Inca**: Still active and winnable. Inca is very weak (1,344 military). Germany should push to capture/l liberate Aachen from Inca and potentially end the war favorably.
            3. **Nuclear arms race**: Russia has 19 Uranium. Germany has 3 Uranium. Need to secure Manhattan Project ASAP.
            4. **Science Victory**: Researching Computers (13 turns left). Then need Satellites for Apollo Program. Must maintain science focus.
            5. **Diplomatic situation**: 
               - Russia is hostile (should remain -95/-95)
               - Inca is at war (should remain -95/-100)
               - India is friend (+12/+12, could improve slightly)
               - Zulu is guarded (-50/-45, peace treaty holds)
               - Greece is hostile (-35/-30)
               - Venice is war (-95/-100) but Venice has 0% war weariness. Germany made peace with their CS ally Tyre. Might want to consider peace with Venice to focus on greater threats.
            
            **Policy**: Futurism still queued (19 turns to next policy, 14 turns). Actually it says NextPolicyTurns: 14. Futurism is queued. Keep it.
            
            **Technology**: Computers (13 turns). After that, should go to Satellites for Apollo Program, OR maybe Advanced Ballistics/Nuclear Fission if available but not listed. The options given are Combined Arms, Satellites, Penicillin. For Science victory, Satellites is essential (Apollo Program). Combined Arms gives Tanks. Penicillin gives Marines and Medical Labs.
            - Satellites is the clear choice for science victory progress.
            
            **Flavors/Grand Strategy**: 
            - Spaceship grand strategy remains correct.
            - Current flavors heavily defensive (Defense 95, CityDefense 95, Antiair 95, Nuke 100, Science 100, Production 100).
            - Need to adjust slightly: We're winning against Inca and Russia just took Cologne. We need to liberate Aachen from Inca quickly. Slightly more offensive posture against Inca may help finish that war.
            - However, Russia remains the existential threat. Keep heavy defense.
            - Naval is high (92) which is good for coast control.
            
            Should I change policy from Futurism? 
            - Futurism gives +2 Culture per Great Work, 50 Tourism per conquered city. Germany has 20 Great Works (so +40 culture). We will be conquering/liberating cities.
            - But with Russia now holding Cologne, and needing military edge, perhaps switching to a more military tenet like **Lightning Warfare** or **Third Alternative** would be better? 
            - However, the queue is already set. The policy tool changes the NEXT selection. We could switch. Let's think:
              - Third Alternative: +100% strategic resources, -25% unit gold maintenance. Germany has 3 Uranium (doubled = 6, still less than Russia), and aluminum/coal/iron. Good but not immediately decisive.
              - Lightning Warfare: +3 movement Great Generals, gunpowder +15% attack ignore ZOC, armored +15% attack +1 movement. Germany doesn't have tanks yet. Has Landships (60 strength) which are fast attack.
              - Martial Spirit: +25% melee attack for 50 turns, -25% war weariness, double razing.
              - Total War: +25% production land units, +25% warscore, easier CS bullying.
              - Police State: +3 local happiness courthouses, +10 security, +100% production courthouses/police stations.
              - Iron Fist: Vassals can't be liberated, +25% CS yields, +50% worker rate. We have no vassals.
              - New World Order: -2 unhappiness/distress, police stations/constabularies +3 culture +5 production, built 100% faster.
            
            Actually, given the extremely defensive position against Russia, **Third Alternative** might be very good for:
            - Doubling strategic resources (especially Uranium from 3 to 6, Aluminum 10 to 20)
            - Reducing unit maintenance (helps economy, Russia at -458 GPT is economically strained)
            
            Or **Total War** for faster land unit production and warscore.
            
            But **Futurism** helps with culture/tourism to counter India's cultural victory. India has 6/6 influential civs. If India gets two tier 3 tenets and builds Citizen Earth Protocol, they win. We need tourism. Futurism helps. Germany gets 50 tourism per conquered city. If we liberate Aachen and eventually retake Cologne/Stuttgart/Dortmund, we'll get tourism.
            
            Actually, looking at cultural victory progress: India is Influential over everyone. They need to get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets and finish Citizen Earth Protocol. India currently has Order with 4 tenets. They need more policies. We have time but need tourism pressure.
            
            I'll keep Futurism as next policy. It was the planned choice and still fits.
            
            **Relationships**:
            1. **Russia**: Must remain -95/-95. They just took Cologne. This is a direct land grab near Germany. Maximum hostility.
            2. **Inca**: Must remain -95/-100. Still at war, need to finish them off/recover Aachen.
            3. **Venice**: Germany is at war with Venice. Venice has 0 military strength basically (360), but Germany has bigger priorities. However, peace with Venice might free up resources. On the other hand, Venice is allied with Inca and Zulu. Making peace might require concessions. I'll consider keeping status quo on Venice (-95/-100) but maybe reduce it slightly if we want peace. Actually, Venice has 0% war weariness and is not a real threat. But peace would take 10 turns of negotiations. Given Russia is immediate threat, keeping war with Venice is a distraction. But looking at the relationship, it's set to -95/-100. Maybe I should keep it. There's no urgent need for peace and it might give warmonger penalties.
            4. **India**: +12/+12 is good. Keep to maintain alliance and potential future cooperation against Russia. India has DoF with Russia though, which is awkward. But India is fighting Inca and Greece.
            5. **Zulu**: -50/-45 with peace treaty until ~431. Keep as is.
            6. **Greece**: -35/-30. Greece is fighting India. No reason to change.
            
            **Persona**: The current persona (Guarded 9, Afraid 9, WarBias 7, WorkAgainst 10, etc.) remains appropriate given Russian threat.
            
            **Technology**: Satellites is the clear choice. Unlocks Apollo Program for science victory. Must research after Computers. 
            
            Wait, the options only list certain technologies. Let me check the available options for `set-research`:
            - Combined Arms
            - Satellites  
            - Penicillin
            
            Satellites is available. I'll set that as next research.
            
            **Flavors**: 
            Current flavors are heavily defensive. Given that:
            - We need to push Inca to liberate Aachen (offensive action needed)
            - Russia just took Cologne and is an existential threat
            - We need to build Manhattan Project (Production, Science)
            - We need navy to contest Russia/Cologne coast (Naval)
            
            Adjustments:
            - Offense: Lower slightly from 65 to 60 or keep 65. Actually, maybe bump to 70 to help finish Inca war quickly.
            - Defense: Keep 95
            - Mobilization: Keep 80
            - CityDefense: Keep 95  
            - MilitaryTraining: Keep 90
            - Nuke: Keep 100
            - UseNuke: 90 (keep - we need deterrent)
            - Naval: 92 (keep - coastal defense and anti-Russia operations)
            - Antiair: 95 (keep - Russia has bombers)
            - Science: 100 (keep - must get techs)
            - Production: 100 (keep - need units/buildings)
            - Spaceship: 90 (keep)
            - Espionage: 95 (keep - spy defense against India/Russia)
            
            One critical addition: **Airlift** is currently 25. Maybe increase to 40 or 50 to enable rapid deployment to threatened fronts? Germany has an Airport in Munich. Airlift capability would help move troops from Frankfurt/Aachen area or between coastal cities. But Russian threat is immediate. Let me think... Airlift infrastructure is Airport-based. Germany has one Airport (Munich). Increasing Airlift flavor would build more airports. That takes too long. Not priority.
            
            **Happiness**: 61% - Germany is Happy but with -4 in Frankfurt and -3 in Aachen. Need to keep happiness up if we capture more cities.
            
            Actually, looking at Germany's cities:
            - Berlin: HappinessDelta +11
            - Hamburg: +12
            - Munich: +7
            - Frankfurt: -4 (unhappy)
            - Dusseldorf: no delta shown but likely okay
            - Aachen: -3 (occupied/puppet?)
            
            Frankfurt and Aachen have unhappiness. Capturing more cities will strain happiness.
            
            **Diplomacy**: Keep status quo with most, but need to ensure Russia relationship stays maximally hostile. 
            
            Should I change anything about India relationship? They are DoF. But they also have DoF with Russia. If Russia attacks Germany, India probably won't help. But keeping positive relations is fine.
            
            **Policy**: Keep Futurism.
            
            **Research**: Set Satellites.
            
            **Flavors**: I should call set-flavors or keep-status-quo. Given the Russian capture of Cologne, I should make some adjustments:
            - Increase Offense slightly (65 -> 75) to push Inca war faster and liberate Aachen
            - Increase Happiness (70 -> 80) because we need to manage occupation unhappiness and prepare for more
            - Keep everything else roughly same
            
            Wait, the staff members execute based on flavors. If I increase Offense to 75, they might overextend against Russia. But Inca is the current enemy. Actually, the tactical AI targets the current war enemy. Higher offense will mean more aggressive attacks against Inca (good - we want Aachen back). It might also mean being more aggressive in posture against Russia (risky). But with Defense/CityDefense at 95, the AI should still be cautious.
            
            Let me think about this differently. The key is:
            1. Finish Inca war, recover Aachen
            2. Deter Russia
            3. Rush Apollo Program/Science victory
            4. Counter India's cultural win with tourism
            
            I'll adjust flavors:
            - Offense: 75 (up from 65 - push Inca, recover territory)
            - Happiness: 80 (up from 70 - manage captured cities)
            - Growth: 65 (up from 60 - recover population in core cities)
            - Keep others same.
            
            Actually, I should reduce some flavor to compensate if I raise others, but the instructions say "Too many priorities weaken impact for each." But if I'm only changing a few from already-high values, it's okay.
            
            Let me keep most status quo but make explicit changes. I'll call `set-flavors` with some updates.
            
            Wait, I also need to check if `set-research` technology must be from the Options list. Yes: Combined Arms, Satellites, Penicillin. Satellites is valid.
            
            For `set-policy`: Options show many policies. Futurism is valid.
            
            Now, the tools I should call:
            1. `set-research`: Satellites (after Computers finishes)
            2. `set-policy`: Futurism (keep next policy)
            3. `set-relationship`: Russia - keep -95/-95 (maybe no need to call if unchanged? But I should verify if it's still active. The strategies show UpdatedTurn: 414, and it's now Turn 424. The relationship modifiers persist "until cancelled (set value = 0)". So no need to reset Russia if unchanged. But the rationale might need updating given Cologne capture. However, I don't have to call it if values are same. But it's good practice to reaffirm critical relationships. Actually, calling with same values might be redundant but acceptable. I'll abstain from calling unchanged relationships.
            
            Actually, I should update Russia relationship rationale at minimum, but the tool only changes values. If values are same, no need.
            
            For `set-flavors` vs `keep-status-quo`: Given Russia captured Cologne and dynamics shifted slightly, `set-flavors` is better to show active management.
            
            Let me reconsider the policy. Is Futurism still the best choice?
            - India has Influential over everyone. 
            - Germany has 0 influential civs.
            - Tourism per turn: Germany 480, India 1189.
            - India has 6/6 Influential, needs ideology tenets and Citizen Earth Protocol.
            - Germany needs to prevent India from winning AND pursue science.
            
            Futurism gives:
            - +2 Culture from Great Works (Germany has ~20 Great Works = +40 culture/tourism infrastructure)
            - 50 Tourism per conquered city
            - Conquered cities: If Germany takes Aachen back from Inca, that's 50 tourism. Future retaking of Cologne from Russia = 50 tourism. Etc.
            
            This is decent but not going to stop India alone. However, it's a tenet. The alternative Level 1 tenets:
            - Lebensraum: 10 culture/GAP per border expand, Citadels in foreign territory, retain tiles after razing. Not great.
            - New World Order: -2 unhappiness, police/constabulary +3 culture +5 production, built faster. Good for happiness and production!
            - Iron Fist: Vassal stuff, +25% CS yields, +50% worker rate. Good but no vassals.
            - Futurism: Tourism/culture focus.
            
            If I switch to New World Order:
            - -2 unhappiness in all cities: Frankfurt (-4 -> -2 or -6?), Aachen (-3 -> -1 or -5?). This would immediately improve happiness.
            - Police Stations/Constabularies get +3 culture, +5 production, built 100% faster.
            - Germany has Constabularies in many cities. Police Stations could be built quickly.
            - This solves happiness problems AND gives production.
            
            Actually, **New World Order** seems much more immediately valuable than Futurism given:
            1. Unhappiness in Frankfurt and Aachen
            2. Need to build more military (production bonus)
            3. Need to counter Russia (production, happiness for war)
            4. It's Level 1 tenet, cheap.
            
            But Futurism helps against India's cultural victory... yet India's cultural victory is primarily about them getting 2 Tier 3 tenets + Citizen Earth Protocol. Tourism pressure on them doesn't directly stop that. It helps prevent them from becoming Influential but they already ARE influential over everyone. The only thing preventing their victory is they haven't built Citizen Earth Protocol yet.
            
            Germany cannot win a cultural victory before India. India is too far ahead. So Futurism's tourism is somewhat wasted. Better to secure internal stability and production with New World Order, or Industrial/Military tenets.
            
            Wait, but policy progress is at 14 turns until next policy. Changing now is fine.
            
            Let me look at what tenets Germany has in Autocracy:
            Looking at policy branches:
            - Autocracy:
              - Elite Forces
              - Military-Industrial Complex
              - United Front
            
            So Germany has 3 Autocracy tenets already. Needs 2 more Level 1 to unlock Level 2. Actually, in Vox Populi ideology structure, you unlock tiers by having enough tenets in that ideology. Germany can pick another Level 1.
            
            New World Order vs Futurism:
            - NWO: immediate happiness relief (-2 unhappiness/needs in ALL cities), fast Police Stations (+3 culture, +5 production), existing Constabularies get buffed. This is HUGE for Germany's current situation. Frankfurt is -4. Reducing that helps immensely. Also, faster Police Stations = more security against spies, more happiness, more production.
            - Futurism: +40 culture, some tourism. Nice but doesn't address structural problems.
            
            Third Alternative (Level 2) isn't available yet - need more tenets.
            
            I think switching to **New World Order** is the correct strategic choice. It gives immediate empire-wide benefits. With Russia breathing down our necks and occupied cities causing unhappiness, -2 unhappiness per city and production boosts are exactly what we need.
            
            Wait, I need to check if New World Order is in the available Options. Yes, it is listed:
            "- New World Order (Level 1 Tenet of Ideology Autocracy): ..."
            
            So I can set policy to New World Order.
            
            Now for research: Satellites is obvious.
            
            Flavors adjustment:
            Given the change in situation (Russia took Cologne), I want to:
            - Ensure strong defense
            - Finish Inca war to liberate Aachen
            - Prepare for possible Russian war
            - Manage happiness
            
            Flavors to set:
            - GrandStrategy: Spaceship (keep)
            - Offense: 75 (up slightly to finish Inca)
            - Defense: 95 (keep)
            - CityDefense: 95 (keep)
            - Mobilization: 85 (up slightly - need units)
            - MilitaryTraining: 90 (keep)
            - Nuke: 100 (keep)
            - UseNuke: 90 (keep)
            - Naval: 95 (up - must contest coast, Russia has naval presence)
            - Antiair: 95 (keep)
            - Air: 90 (keep)
            - Ranged: 90 (keep)
            - Mobile: 80 (keep)
            - Production: 100 (keep)
            - Science: 100 (keep)
            - Spaceship: 90 (keep)
            - Happiness: 85 (up - need happiness for occupied cities and future conquests)
            - Infrastructure: 95 (keep - roads/connections for troop movement)
            - Espionage: 95 (keep)
            - Growth: 60 (keep)
            - Gold: 85 (keep)
            
            I think I'll set flavors with these values and rationale.
            
            Relationship updates:
            - Russia: The relationship values are already -95/-95 and should remain. The tool requires me to send only if I intend to change. Since it's already at -95/-95 and unchanged, I don't strictly need to call it. But the rationale in strategies is old (Turn 414). If I don't call it, it persists. I think it's better to call to update the rationale for Turn 424 given Cologne capture. But wait, set-relationship requires values. If I send -95/-95 again, that's fine - it replaces the modifier with same values. Actually it says "additive diplomatic modifiers" - so setting -95 again might double? No, it says "The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to staff members' existing evaluation." But then it says "The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0)". So setting it again likely overwrites the previous set value, not adds to it. Setting it to -95 again should be safe. But is it necessary? Maybe not. I'll skip to avoid any additive confusion unless the system overwrites.
            
            Actually, I probably don't need to set relationships if they haven't changed. The system says "set values you intend to change". I'll leave relationships alone except if critical.
            
            But wait - **Venice**: Germany is at war with Venice (0% war weariness on both sides). Venice is far away and not a threat. Peace with Venice would remove a distraction and maybe allow trade routes? But Venice sports 360 military, irrelevant. However, Germany denounced Venice and vice versa. Making peace might be hard. But there might be value. On the other hand, Venice is allied with Zulu and Inca (DoF). Keeping war maintains pressure. I'll leave Venice alone.
            
            What about **India**: Should I increase positive relations? India is DoF with Russia. But India is also fighting Russia's allies (Inca). It's complicated. +12 is decent. I'll leave it.
            
            So my calls will be:
            1. `set-policy`: New World Order (switch from Futurism)
            2. `set-research`: Satellites (after Computers)
            3. `set-flavors`: Adjusted values as above, Spaceship grand strategy
            
            Wait, do I need to call keep-status-quo? No, I'm calling set-flavors.
            
            Let me triple check the rationale:
            - New World Order: Germany faces severe happiness pressure from occupied/captured cities (Frankfurt -4, Aachen -3) and the recent Russian capture of Cologne adds more urgency. New World Order provides immediate -2 unhappiness from all needs in all cities, plus massive production boosts to Police Stations and Constabularies. This addresses internal stability while boosting defensive production capacity against the Russian threat. Futurism's tourism bonuses are less critical than empire stability when facing a 4.6x superior military adversary.
            - Satellites: Apollo Program is prerequisite for Science Victory. Germany is pursuing Spaceship grand strategy and Computers completes in 13 turns. Setting Satellites next ensures continuous progress toward Apollo Program and keep pace in the space race.
            - Flavors: Russia's capture of Cologne demonstrates aggressive expansionism right on Germany's doorstep. Offense increased to 75 to rapidly finish the Inca war and liberate Aachen. Naval increased to 95 to contest the increasingly hot coastal zone near Cologne where Russian fleet destroyers and submarines are active. Happiness increased to 85 to manage occupation penalties and prepare for future city recoveries. Mobilization increases to 85 to accelerate unit production against 15,440 Russian military strength. All defensive and scientific priorities remain at maximum.
            
            I should also consider if I need to set persona. Persona was set with Rationale at some point. Current values seem fine. No changes needed there.
            
            Double-checking available options for technology: Combined Arms, Satellites, Penicillin. Yes, Satellites is valid.
            
            Double-checking available options for policy: 
            - Martial Spirit, Total War, Third Alternative, Lightning Warfare, Mare Nostrum, Futurism, Police State, Lebensraum, New World Order, Iron Fist, Syndicalism (Autocracy tenets)
            - Heritage, Exploitation, Shadow Networks, National Treasure (Continuing branches)
            - Rights of Man, Enlightenment (Rationalism)
            - Industry, Fealty, Authority, Tradition (New branches)
            
            Yes, New World Order is valid.
            
            One more thought: Is there any reason to pick Total War instead? +25% production building land units, +25% warscore, easier CS bullying. With Russia threat, more land unit production is good. But New World Order gives production too (to Police Stations/Constabularies) AND happiness. Happiness is the bottleneck. So NWO > Total War for now.
            
            Actually, another option: set-flavors doesn't require listing everything. "Only send in values you intend to change." So I should only include the ones changing.
            
            Values I want to change from current:
            - Offense: 75 (was 65)
            - Naval: 95 (was 92)
            - Happiness: 85 (was 70)
            - Mobilization: 85 (was 80)
            
            Wait, current Mobilization is 80, I said 85. But is that worth it? Maybe keep 80. It's fine.
            
            Actually, I want to make sure these numbers are correct:
            Current flavors show:
            - Offense: 65
            - Defense: 95
            - Mobilization: 80
            - CityDefense: 95
            - MilitaryTraining: 90
            - Recon: 70
            - Ranged: 90
            - Mobile: 80
            - Nuke: 100
            - UseNuke: 90
            - Naval: 92
            - NavalRecon: 45
            - NavalGrowth: 30
            - NavalTileImprovement: 0
            - Air: 90
            - AirCarrier: 35
            - Antiair: 95
            - Airlift: 25
            - Expansion: 0
            - Growth: 60
            - TileImprovement: 20
            - Infrastructure: 95
            - Production: 100
            - WaterConnection: 35
            - Gold: 85
            - Science: 100
            - Culture: 35
            - Happiness: 70
            - GreatPeople: 45
            - Wonder: 5
            - Religion: 20
            - Diplomacy: 75
            - Spaceship: 90
            - Espionage: 95
            
            I should include GrandStrategy: Spaceship in my set-flavors call to maintain it.
            
            Changed flavors:
            - Offense: 75
            - Naval: 95
            - Happiness: 85
            
            Maybe also:
            - Air: 92 (up slightly)
            - CityDefense: keep same
            
            Wait, I realize I need to be careful. "Only send in values you intend to change." I should send only my changes, plus GrandStrategy since I'm maintaining it and it should be explicit? Actually the parameter is optional. If I don't send it, does it keep the old one? Probably. But the instructions say "set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors." So I should include GrandStrategy.
            
            Let me include:
            - GrandStrategy: Spaceship
            - Offense: 75
            - Naval: 95  
            - Happiness: 85
            - Mobilization: 85
            
            That's 5 changes. Everything else stays.
            
            Are these good values? Range is 0-100. 85 is high but not max. Good.
            
            Wait, what about Infrastructure? It's 95. Keep. Production 100. Keep.
            
            One more check: The instruction says "For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything." 
            - For set-policy: New World Order is listed under Options.
            - For set-research: Satellites is listed under Options.
            - For set-flavors: The flavor names match exactly Offense, Naval, Happiness, Mobilization. All listed in Options.
            
            Great.
            
            I will call 3 tools:
            1. set-policy: New World Order
            2. set-research: Satellites
            3. set-flavors: Spaceship grand strategy, Offense 75, Naval 95, Happiness 85, Mobilization 85
            
            Rationale need to be concise.
            
            Should I also call set-relationship for Russia to reaffirm -95? The existing set relationship will persist until set to 0. Since I'm not changing it, I don't need to call. But I should mention Russia in my strategy rationale.
            
            Wait, I just realized: The captured city Cologne was puppeted by Russia. Germany was at war with Inca. Now Russia holds Cologne. This doesn't directly change Germany's war with Inca, but it means if Germany wanted to liberate Cologne, now they have to fight Russia instead of Inca. 
            
            Also, is Aachen still under Germany? Yes, Aachen (ID 16810) is listed as Owner: Germany. Wait, looking at Cities under Germany:
            - Aachen: Owner: Germany, Population 17. But looking at Military section, Friendly Land Zone 16810 is City: Aachen. Wait, earlier in strategies it said "Aachen and Cologne under occupation." Let me check the city list again.
            
            In the Cities section:
            ### Aachen
            - ID: 16810
            - Owner: Germany? Wait, looking closely:
            Under "Opponent: Germany":
            ### Aachen
            - ID: 16810
            - Owner: 6 Germany? Let me re-read...
            
            Actually at the top:
            ```
            ### Aachen
            - ID: 16810
            - X: 65
            - Y: 29
            - Population: 17
            - DefenseStrength: 71
            - IsCoastal: true
            ...
            - Owner: 6: Germany (in events, but in city list it just shows under "Opponent: Germany" meaning it's German-owned.
            ```
            
            Wait, earlier in strategy rationale: "Cologne siege making excellent progress... and Paratrooper positioning for capture and liberation of German territory. Germany ... holds Aachen and Cologne under occupation". That was the rationale from Turn 412-414. Looking at the Cities list now:
            - Cologne: Under Russia (just captured from Inca)
            - Aachen: Listed under "Opponent: Germany" section - so Germany owns Aachen? Let me check Inca's cities... Inca cities are Cusco, Corihuayrachina, Huamanga, Vitcos, Ica. Aachen is NOT listed as Inca city. So Germany must have recaptured Aachen already? Or it was never lost?
            
            Hold on. Let me search for Aachen in the events... No capture event for Aachen. Wait, in Turn 411 events there was: "EspionageState: SpyIndex: 3, SpyState: 1, City: Aachen, SpyOwner: 3 The Inca". So Inca has a spy in Aachen. But that doesn't mean they own it.
            
            Looking back at an older report (Turn 412 rationale): "Germany holds Aachen and Cologne under occupation - these cities must be LIBERATED." This is confusing. Maybe the writer meant Germany holds Aachen (its own city) but Cologne was under occupation? Or maybe Aachen was occupied by Inca previously and Germany recaptured it. Actually, Aachen is listed under Germany's cities with Ottawa-style stats, so Germany currently owns it. The previous rationale might have been mistaken or outdated. Actually, no - the current city list shows Aachen as a German city with German production. If it were occupied, it would say IsOccupied: true or be under another opponent. So Aachen is German.
            
            But wait, in the first paragraph under # Situation / # Events, I see nothing about Aachen being occupied now. The Turn 412 rationale saying "Germany holds Aachen and Cologne under occupation" may have been describing that Germany had captured them back or was in the process. But looking at current data: Cologne is Russian (just captured from Inca). Aachen is German.
            
            This means:
            - Stuttgart and Dortmund are Russian-occupied (from earlier)
            - Cologne is now Russian (just captured from Inca, but originally German)
            - Aachen is German
            
            So Germany still needs to liberate Stuttgart, Dortmund, and now Cologne from Russia.
            
            This makes the Russian threat EVEN MORE pressing.
            
            Okay, with this understanding:
            - The war with Inca: Germany is winning (+32%). But Cologne (original German city held by Inca) was just taken by Russia. Inca still has... what? Which German cities? Actually, looking at Inca city list: Cusco, Corihuayrachina, Huamanga, Vitcos, Ica. None are German original cities. So maybe Inca didn't hold any original German cities? Wait, but earlier it said Germany lost cities to Russia and Inca. Let me check:
            Russia holds: Stuttgart, Dortmund, Cologne (now), Washington, New York, Vilcas, Andahuaylas, Machu, Tiwanaku, Ollantaytambo, Vatican City. Many of these are from America and Inca.
            
            Hmm. Actually, maybe Aachen was built by Germany and never lost. Cologne was originally German, lost to Inca, now Russia. 
            
            Regardless, Russia is the paramount threat holding multiple original capitals and cities.
            
            Given this, finishing the Inca war is still useful (removes an enemy, frees up troops, gives score), but Russia is the real target.
            
            Actually, looking back: War with Inca. Germany score +32%. Inca war weariness 81%. This war should be pressed to conclusion to force peace or take cities.
            
            I think my decisions hold.
            
            One more check: Should I consider changing relationship with **Inca** slightly less hostile to make peace once Cologne was taken by Russia? But Inca is weak and Germany is winning. If peace is made, Germany gets nothing. Inca has no German cities anymore (Cologne is now Russian). Wait - does Inca hold any German cities? Let me search the city list again for German-named cities under Inca... No. The Inca city list only shows Cusco, Corihuayrachina, Huamanga, Vitcos, Ica. So Inca does NOT currently hold any German cities. The war with Inca is just a resource drain now, though Germany is winning. However, ending it would free troops for Russia.
            
            Actually, since Inca has no German cities, and Germany has a +32% warscore, maybe making peace is better? But there's no incentive for Inca to give anything. They might offer peace. The AI will handle it. Keeping max hostility means Germany might try to capture something (like Cusco? No, too far). 
            
            Wait, but Germany doesn't need to capture Inca cities. Science victory is the goal. Ending the Inca war allows focusing on Russia deterrence. But the staff members might make peace automatically if it's advantageous. High Offense flavor means they'll keep fighting.
            
            Since Inca is allied with Zulu (defensive pact) and Zulu peace treaty expires in ~7 turns (Turn 431, currently Turn 424, so 7 turns). If Germany is still at war with Inca when Zulu peace expires, Zulu might join against Germany. This is a MAJOR concern.
            
            Wait, Zulu-Inca defensive pact! If Germany attacks Inca, Zulu could intervene when their peace treaty with Germany expires. Germany should make peace with Inca BEFORE Turn 431 to avoid fighting both. That's crucial!
            
            Current turn: 424. Peace treaty with Zulu expires in ~7 turns (probably turn 431 or so). Germany is at war with Inca.
            
            To avoid Zulu entering the war, Germany should PEACE OUT with Inca ASAP. But I set Offense to 75... that might prevent peace. Actually, relationship and flavors affect AI behavior but peace decisions are also based on warscore. With +32% warscore, Germany could get a decent peace. But the AI might not offer if war bias is high.
            
            Actually, I should consider lowering Offense or even setting it to make peace more likely. But there's no direct "desire peace" flavor. The persona settings (WarBias) affect this. Currently WarBias is 7. If I increase FriendlyBias or decrease WarBias, it might help. But I don't want to decrease WarBias because Russia threat requires it.
            
            Alternatively, if Germany keeps winning against Inca and the warscore is positive, the Inca might offer peace. Zulu might not honor defensive pact if Inca is the aggressor (defensive pacts trigger when ally is attacked, but if peace is made, no issue).
            
            Actually, in Civ V, a defensive pact triggers if the ally is DECLARED WAR UPON. Germany declared war on Inca (or vice versa originally). The pact might trigger when the peace treaty expires regardless of who started it? Defensive pacts activate when a pact member is attacked. Since the war is ongoing, when the Zulu-Germany peace treaty expires, if Zulu has a defensive pact with Inca, Zulu MIGHT not automatically join an existing war - defensive pacts usually trigger on new declarations. But I'm not sure how Vox Populi handles it.
            
            However, if Germany makes peace with Inca, there's zero risk.
            
            Given the paramount threat of Russia, Germany CANNOT afford a two-front war with Zulu and Inca. Peace with Inca is strategically wise. But I already set Offense to 75... maybe I should set it lower, like 55, to deprioritize offensive operations and increase chance of peace acceptance? 
            
            Wait, the warscore is +32% which is good. Maybe reducing hostility toward Inca slightly? But the relationship is -95/-100. That's maximum. The staff members will be very reluctant to make peace.
            
            Should I reduce Inca relationship from -95 to something like -40 to facilitate peace? That's a big change. The rationale would be: "Inca no longer holds German territory; with Zulu peace treaty expiring soon, Germany must avoid two-front war. Reducing hostility to enable negotiated peace that preserves German war gains and frees military resources for Russian front."
            
            This is actually a very strong strategic argument. Let me think about this carefully.
            
            If I set Inca relationship to, say, -30 (Public/Private), the staff members will be more willing to accept peace terms. But will they give up too much? With +32% warscore, Germany can likely get a favorable peace.
            
            But wait - I denounced Inca and vice versa. We're at war. If I set relationship to -30, it doesn't force peace, just makes the AI more inclined.
            
            Actually, let's look at flavors. If I lower Offense to 50 or 55, the staff might focus more on defense and less on attacking Inca. Combined with less hostile relationship, peace becomes likely.
            
            But do I WANT peace with Inca right now? 
            Pros:
            - Frees troops for Russia front
            - Prevents Zulu defensive pact activation
            - Removes war weariness (38% currently)
            - Allows focusing on science
            
            Cons:
            - Inca keeps their cities
            - No captured cities for tourism/score
            - India is fighting Inca; peace might help Inca against India (not our concern directly)
            
            Given Russia's 15,440 military and Germany's 3,335, Germany needs every soldier on the Russian border. Fighting Inca is a luxury. Peace is strategically correct.
            
            But can I achieve peace by Turn 431? That's 7 turns. Maybe.
            
            However, one thing: Germany's relationship with Inca includes "You are at war! (-99999)" in the opinion calculation. Changing the modifier from -100 to -30 might not overcome that. The AI will still hate us. But it helps.
            
            Wait, looking at the OpinionToThem for Inca:
            - We fought together... 55
            - Similar Social Policies 3
            - denounced DoF friend -11
            - DoF with enemy -13
            - Defensive Pact with enemy -15
            - Religious differences -30
            - spies caught -33
            - stole territory -50
            - Public opinion -95
            - Private opinion -100
            - Ideology -999
            - At war -99999
            
            So the -95/-100 I set is negligible compared to -99999 war penalty and -999 ideology. Changing it won't matter for peace willingness. The war itself is the dominant factor. Peace will happen when the AI decides the war is over.
            
            Actually, the peace treaty decision in Civ V is based on warscore primarily. At +32% warscore, Germany could probably force Inca to make peace if Germany stops attacking. But the AI controls this.
            
            If I set Offense to 55 (down from 65), the staff will attack less hard, reducing warscore gains but also losses. Inca might be more willing to make a white peace.
            
            But with Russia active, I think deprioritizing the Inca front is correct. Let me lower Offense to 55.
            
            Wait, I was going to increase it to 75. Now I'm reconsidering. 
            
            Let's look at the tactical zones:
            - Friendly Land Zone 16810 (Aachen) has German units: Paratrooper x2, Rifleman x3, Krupp Gun x1. That's a strong force. Are they attacking? There's no Inca city near Aachen in the military zones... Wait, Aachen is at 66,29. The neighbor is -6078 (Frankfurt sea zone). No enemy nearby.
            
            Looking at the map, German forces seem positioned for defense or localized offense. If there's no active combat, Offense flavor doesn't matter much except for production priorities.
            
            Actually, German zone near Inca? I don't see any. The closest is Antananarivo (41,16) which neighbors Ollantaytambo (37,20) - Russian troops there. No German-Inca border shown in tactical zones. Wait, how is Germany at war with Inca then? Maybe naval engagements? Events mention German destroyers near Cologne (now Russian) and Trowulan.
            
            If there's no land border, the war with Inca is mostly naval. The Inca war may be prosecuted by Germany's navy near Trowulan/Cologne. If Germany isn't actively attacking, peace could be achieved.
            
            I'll set Offense to 55 (slightly reduced) to de-emphasize the Inca conflict. This is a significant change.
            
            Revised flavor changes:
            - GrandStrategy: Spaceship
            - Offense: 55 (down from 65 - reduce pressure on Inca to enable peace before Zulu treaty expires)
            - Naval: 95 (up from 92 - contest coast)
            - Happiness: 85 (up from 70 - manage cities)
            
            Should I also lower Mobilization? Keep at 80.
            
            Actually, I'll keep Mobilization at 80 (no change).
            
            Okay, this feels like a robust plan:
            1. set-policy to New World Order
            2. set-research to Satellites  
            3. set-flavors with Spaceship, Offense 55, Naval 95, Happiness 85
            
            Wait, do I need to call `set-relationship` for Inca to reduce hostility since I'm changing strategy? The tool changes additive modifiers. Since I concluded that the -95 doesn't matter compared to -99999 war penalty, I won't bother. The staff AI for peace is more driven by warscore and whether they think they can win. By lowering Offense, I signal de-escalation.
            
            Actually, one more thing: `set-persona`. I don't need to change it.
            
            Let me write out the tool calls precisely.
            
            ```json
            [
              { "tool": "set-policy", "arguments": { "Policy": "New World Order", "Rationale": "Switching from Futurism to New World Order. Germany faces severe happiness pressure (Frankfurt -4, Aachen -3) and an existential Russian threat (15,440 military, 4.6x advantage). New World Order provides immediate -2 unhappiness from all needs in every city, plus +3 Culture and +5 Production to Police Stations and Constabularies with doubled construction speed, directly improving internal stability and defensive production. Futurism's tourism bonuses are secondary to empire survival." } },
              { "tool": "set-research", "arguments": { "Technology": "Satellites", "Rationale": "Satellites unlocks the Apollo Program, a mandatory project for Science Victory. Germany is committed to the Spaceship grand strategy and will finish Computers in 13 turns. Setting Satellites next ensures continuous progress toward the space race and prevents falling behind competitors." } },
              { "tool": "set-flavors", "arguments": { "GrandStrategy": "Spaceship", "Flavors": { "Offense": 55, "Naval": 95, "Happiness": 85 }, "Rationale": "Russia's capture of Cologne from Inca puts a hostile superpower even closer to German core territory. Offense lowered to 55 to deprioritize the Inca naval war and enable a negotiated peace before the Zulu defensive pact activates when the Zulu-German peace treaty expires (~Turn 431). Naval raised to 95 to contest the hot coastal zone near Cologne and maintain sea control against Russian destroyers/submarines. Happiness raised to 85 to manage occupation penalties and prepare for recovering lost German cities." } }
            ]
            ```
            
            Wait, I should double check that New World Order is the exact name. Yes, in the options:
            "- New World Order (Level 1 Tenet of Ideology Autocracy): ..."
            
            And Satellites is exact.
            
            Let me review if I missed anything critical.
            - Computers finishes in 13 turns, policy in 14 turns. Both Satellites and New World Order are good next steps.
            - Relationships: No tool calls needed for unchanged relationships.
            - Persona: No changes.
            - Keep-status-quo: Not using, using set-flavors instead.
            
            This looks complete and well-reasoned.
