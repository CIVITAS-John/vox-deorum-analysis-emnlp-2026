  - rationale: TURN 449 TERMINAL DEFIANCE POSTURE: Manhattan Project completes Turn 450 - increase Nuke and UseNuke to 100 to seize any opportunity for atomic retaliation against Byzantine/German aggressors should uranium be located in final 3 turns. Elevate Defense 80→90 and CityDefense 60→70 following infantry loss at Tiflis; critical to prevent city captures before inevitable Turn 453 diplomatic defeat. Recon 40 prioritizes uranium tile discovery to enable bomb construction. Reduce Spaceship 90→50 (victory impossible) but maintain dignity through scientific-industrial capacity. Production 100/Science 100 retained for maximum final score accumulation in remaining turns.

    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - You can ask your specialized briefers to prepare focused reports (only for) the next turn by calling the `focus-briefer` tool.
        - You have three specialized briefers: Military, Economy, and Diplomacy analysts.
        - Only ask for information relevant to the macro-level decisions in your control. 
       - Your briefer(s) ONLY have limited information of the current game state.
        - Your briefer(s) DO NOT have control over tactical decisions and cannot predict tactical AI's next decision.
        - Your briefer(s) ARE BEST on summarizing and synthesizing factual information, NOT analyzing, projecting, or predicting.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.

      - Players: summary reports about visible players in the world.
        - You will receive in-game AI's diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each player's publicly available relationships.

        - Chattiness: 8
        - DeceptiveBias: 3
        - Rationale: TURN 444 EXISTENTIAL RESOLUTION: Byzantium's 41 delegates with 9 turns until vote creates unwinnable position. Accepting inevitable diplomatic defeat with dignity - maintain maximum Loyalty and Friendship to true allies (America, Austria) who stood with Order bloc until the end. Increase DenounceWillingness to 10 and Meanness to 5 to signal final defiance against Byzantine hegemony and German aggression. No longer attempting psychological manipulation of Shoshone (failed strategy) - accepting their ideological choice while preserving personal integrity through unbroken loyalty to actual allies.
        
        ## Technology
        - Next: None
        
        ## Policy
        - Next: Spaceflight Pioneers (Policy)
        - Rationale: SPACE-FLIGHT PIONEERS AFFIRMATION: Policy selection remains optimal despite diplomatic defeat inevitability. Free Great Engineer and Great Scientist provide immediate tangible benefits for Turn 448 accumulation. Maintains philosophical consistency with Order ideology's scientific-industrial legacy. Alternative tenets (Socialist Realism, Iron Curtain) irrelevant given no remaining time for tourism/production infrastructure to matter. Spaceflight Pioneers maximizes final score through Great Person yields.
        
        ## Relationships
        
        ### Argos
        - Public: 65
        - Private: 60
        - Rationale: ARGOS INVESTMENT PHASE TRANSITION: Reduce from 80/75 to 65/60. Missionary arrival and Buddhism conversion completed successfully; quest satisfied but influence remains 0 (Neutral). Shift from urgent execution priority to sustained investment priority. Requires 100 influence for +3 delegates. Moderate-high signals maintain attention while acknowledging longer investment timeline compared to Colombo/Brussels near-thresholds.
        - UpdatedTurn: 218
        
        ### Raqmu
        - Public: 95
        - Private: 90
        - Rationale: URGENT RAQMU LONGSWORDSMAN QUEST: Quest expires in ~5 turns and offers +92-138 influence (3 delegates critical for Turn 236 Congress). Increasing priority from 40/35 to 95/90 ensures AI prioritizes producing/gifting experienced Longswordsman despite supply constraints (30/31). Securing these 3 delegates combined with Colombo (+3) and Rio (+3) projections achieves 16-17 total delegates - within competitive range of Austria's expansion.
        - UpdatedTurn: 219
        
        ### M'banza-Kongo
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: M'BANZA-KONGO SOI FAIR ACCOMPLI: Austrian Sphere of Influence enacted Turn 312, confirmed permanent ally status for Austria (719 influence vs Spain 53). Reset from 100/95 to 0/0 to reallocate diplomatic AI attention and gold to achievable city-state objectives (Colombo Hotel quest, Luba tribute, Shanghai maintenance).
        - UpdatedTurn: 352
        
        ### France
        - Public: 80
        - Private: 75
        - Rationale: FRANCE DELEGATE SECURITY PRIORITY: Increase from 65/60 to 80/75. France provides 3 critical delegates currently voting with Order bloc (22 vs Freedom 21). Despite vassal status to Mongolia and -50 opinion, their delegate votes count regardless. Elevated signals ensure continued Order alignment and prevent swing to Freedom bloc which would create 22-24 delegate deficit. France's vote decisive for blocking Byzantine UN proposal.
        - UpdatedTurn: 404
        
        ### Luba
        - Public: 30
        - Private: 25
        - Rationale: LUBA PRIORITY REDUCTION—OPEN DOOR CONSTRAINT: Reduce from 100/95 to 30/25. Open Door policy enacted prevents Ally status regardless of influence investment (capped at 40). Tribute quest delegates unachievable through normal means. Current 159 influence sufficient for Friends status maintenance but maximum diplomatic AI attention wasteful. Reallocate resources to convertible city-states (Assur Buddhism quest, +5 delegates) and spy mission venues (Shanghai) where delegate acquisition possible. Preserve basic positive relations for potential Open Door repeal scenario.
        - UpdatedTurn: 407
        
        ### Shanghai
        - Public: 30
        - Private: 25
        - Rationale: SHANGHAI PRIORITY REDUCTION - Open Door policy permanently blocks Ally status (capped at 40). Previous maximum priority failed to establish spy network despite 10+ turns of signaling. Influence at 11 (Neutral) with spy mission unreliable. Reallocate diplomatic AI attention to achievable objectives (Colombo Buddhism quest) where delegate acquisition possible. Maintain basic positive relations for potential Open Door repeal later.
        - UpdatedTurn: 413
        
        ### Mongolia
        - Public: -30
        - Private: -25
        - Rationale: MONGOLIA WAR REALITY: Despite peace treaty expiration, war declared with Autocracy ideological gap (-999). Setting negative values reflects hostile strategic reality and directs diplomatic AI away from cooperation. Mongolian 3 delegates unlikely to vote with Order; better to focus on achievable Order bloc cohesion (America, Austria, Shoshone).
        - UpdatedTurn: 420
        
        ### Manila

        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: MANILA WAR STATUS RESET: Previously 100/95 priority for spy mission, but Manila declared war (German ally). Reset to 0/0 acknowledges war status prevents cooperation. Reallocate diplomatic attention to non-hostile city-states where influence possible (Brussels, Rio, Colombo if peace restored).

        ### Shedet
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: SHEDET WAR STATUS RESET: Previously 95/90 priority for Buddhist conversion/SOI repeal. Shedet declared war (Byzantine ally). Reset to 0/0 reflects current hostility. Shedet remains Byzantine SOI; cannot be ally while at war. Redirect resources to non-warring Order-aligned objectives.

        ### Assur
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: ASSUR WAR STATUS RESET: Previously 100/95 for Buddhism conversion quest. Germany (Assur's SOI master) at war with Spain; Assur declared war per German alliance. Reset to 0/0 acknowledges war prevents quest completion. SOI mechanics already blocked ally status; war makes impossible.

        ### Brussels
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: SHANGHAI WAR STATUS RESET: Previously 30/25 after Open Door reality check. Now at war (Byzantine ally). 0/0 signals suspension of cooperation. Open Door capped influence at 40; war reduces to 0. Monitor for future Open Door repeal opportunity post-war.

        ### Sydney
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: SYDNEY WAR STATUS ACKNOWLEDGMENT: Australian city-state declared war as German ally. Neutral 0/0 establishes non-cooperation stance. Sydney was German SOI ally; no loss of influence since SOI permanent regardless. Focus diplomatic resources on achievable Order bloc consolidation.
        - UpdatedTurn: 420
        
        ### Genoa
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: GENOA WAR STATUS CONFIRMATION: Previously reset to 0/0 after German SOI enacted. Now at war as German ally. Confirm 0/0 maintains neutral stance. German SOI permanent; war changes nothing strategically but confirms no resource allocation needed.
        - UpdatedTurn: 420
        
        ### Warsaw
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: WARSAW WAR STATUS CONFIRMATION: Neutral 0/0 maintained. Previously reset due to German SOI. War status with German ally confirmed; no change to relationship value as already neutralized.
        - UpdatedTurn: 420
        
        ### Kabul
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: KABUL WAR STATUS NORMALIZATION: Previously 20/15 minimal engagement. Now at war as German ally. Reset 0/0 eliminates lingering positive signals. German SOI blocks ally status regardless.
        - UpdatedTurn: 420
        
        ### Huari
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: HUARI STATUS CONFIRMATION: Maintains 0/0 from previous setting. Buddhist quest expired; Byzantine SOI active; now at war. No diplomatic avenue available.
        - UpdatedTurn: 420
        
        ### Colombo
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 95
        - Rationale: COLOMBO MISSIONARY EXECUTION PRIORITY: Maximum signals maintained (100/95). Quest has 24 turns remaining with +202 influence reward (+3 delegates critical for UN positioning). Despite Open Door capping effective influence at 40, completing quest still provides delegates and removes Protestantism threat from Order-aligned city-state. Faith available (580), missionary cost (135) affordable - ensure tactical AI prioritizes Faith purchase and dispatch from Madrid (84 Faith/turn generation) this turn. Travel time 12-15 turns fits comfortably within deadline.
        - UpdatedTurn: 428
        
        ### Germany
        - Public: -40
        - Private: -35
        - Rationale: GERMAN SANCTION ESCALATION: Increase -35/-30 to -40/-35. Germany proposed Sanction: Spain - devastating economic blow if passed (20 delegates voting). German sphere controls 5 city-states (Warsaw, Kabul, Manila, Assur, Genoa) all at war with Spain. Shore up domestic economy via factory purchases/production. Hostility signals align with total war reality; no diplomatic solution with Autocracy bloc.
        - UpdatedTurn: 429
        
        ### America
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 95
        - Rationale: AMERICA MAXIMUM ORDER SOLIDARITY: Increase 95/90 to 100/95. America provides 6 Order delegates. Despite Sanction: America blocking trade (imposed Turn 280), America voting alignment crucial. Maximum signals show Order bloc unity transcends sanctions. Religious differences (-30) and some diplomatic friction require extra relationship investment to overcome. America also at war with Shoshone - our Defensive Pact with Shoshone is complicating factor we must manage carefully with both parties.
        - UpdatedTurn: 436
        
        ### Austria
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 95
        - Rationale: AUSTRIA MAXIMUM ORDER BLOC COHESION: Increase from 95/90 to 100/95. Austria provides 9 critical Order delegates. Any Austria wavering drops Order bloc to 13 delegates, irrelevant for vote blocking. Austria-Byzantium war and shared Order ideology (999 bonus) create foundation, but maximum signals ensure Austria maintains Order-line voting against Freedom proposal. Critical for post-442 positioning if Byzantine fails to reach 45.
        - UpdatedTurn: 439
        
        ### Rio de Janeiro
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: RIO DE JANEIRO WAR STATUS CONFIRMATION: Turn 424 set 100/95 priority for gold gift bridge to Ally (29 points short at 316 influence). However, Rio is now confirmed Byzantine Ally (496 influence, Protected status), automatically triggering war status with Spain due to Byzantine war. War penalty sets influence to -60, rendering high relationship signals obsolete. Reset to 0/0 reallocated diplomatic AI attention away from impossible city-state cooperation toward achievable objectives (Colombo quest monitoring, Luba maintenance). Rio effectively locked behind Byzantine alliance until war ends or Open Door enacted.
        - UpdatedTurn: 441
        
        ### Byzantium
        - Public: -70
        - Private: -65
        - Rationale: BYZANTIUM MAXIMUM DEFIANCE: Increase hostility to maximum practical levels. Byzantium (41 delegates, 46,785 military strength) represents both diplomatic and military existential threat. Setting -70/-65 signals final refusal to submit psychologically despite inevitable defeat. No room for negotiation with Freedom hegemon that imposed World Ideology and dominates Congress.
        - UpdatedTurn: 445
        
        ### The Shoshone
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: SHOSHONE ACCEPTANCE OF REALITY: Reset from 100/100 to 0/0. Shoshone decisively voted Byzantine in previous vote despite maximum relations; their 10 delegates will deliver victory to Byzantium in Turn 452. Accepting this outcome rather than continuing futile psychological manipulation. Maintains Defensive Pact obligations technically but acknowledges relationship's effective end through ideological incompatibility.
        - UpdatedTurn: 445
        
        ## Strategy
        - Rationale: TURN 448 TERMINAL ADJUSTMENT: Manhattan Project 2 turns from completion - reduce Nuke flavor from 100 to 60 (sufficient to complete project without over-prioritization). INCREASE Defense 65→80 and CityDefense 45→60: Tiflis infantry loss creates vulnerability; must ensure city isn't captured before Turn 450 Manhattan completion. Maintain Production 100/Science 100 for maximum final score. Spaceship 90 reflects dignity-keeping scientific focus despite no actual victory possible. Reduce Infrastructure 90→80, Gold 80→70, Happiness 75→60 - reallocate to defensive priorities for 4-turn survival window.

        ## Military Briefing
        **Military Intelligence Brief – Turn 449**  
        *Prepared for Isabella, Leader of Spain (Player 3)*  
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Tactical Developments Since Turn 444  
        
        | Zone / City | New / Up‑graded Units | Combat Outcomes (Spain) | Enemy Activity |
        |-------------|----------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
        | **Madrid** (Land 1060) | No new units. Existing garrison (2 Infantry, 1 Special Forces, 2 Machine Guns, 1 Paratrooper) unchanged. | – No ground combat this turn. | German naval units continue to patrol the adjacent sea zone; no land incursion. |
        | **Barcelona** (Land 1276) | No new land units; composition unchanged (1 Paratrooper, 2 Artillery, 2 Special Forces, 2 Machine Guns). | – No land combat. | German sea‑zone remains enemy‑dominated (Fleet Destroyers, Dreadnought). No amphibious landings observed. |
        | **Toledo** (Land 3336) | No changes; garrison stable (1 Artillery, 3 Machine Guns, 1 City‑State Infantry). | – No combat. | Sea‑zone enemy‑dominated (German Fleet Destroyer). |
        | **Tiflis** (Land 10390) | Garrison unchanged (1 Infantry, 1 Bomber, 1 Paratrooper). | **Combat #0 (Plains Hills 42,22)** – Spanish Paratrooper (ID 19473) took 34 % damage, survived. <br>**Combat #1 (Snow Land 36,7)** – Spanish Infantry (ID 19596) killed; remained unit count −1. | Byzantine Light Tank and German Bomber still present in adjacent sea zone; German air presence persists. |
        | **Coastal/Sea – Tiflis** (Sea ‑10390) | No Spanish naval units present. | **Combat #4 (Ocean 39,11)** – German Fleet Destroyer (ID 19028) survived Spanish attack; Spanish destroyer‑type units not present. | German fleet (Battleship 1, Fleet Destroyers 10, Krupp Gun 1) dominates the sea zone. |
        | **Coastal/Sea – Barcelona** (Sea ‑3336) | No Spanish naval units present. | – No direct sea combat this turn. | German Fleet Destroyer (ID 20339, promoted) continues to hold the zone. |
        | **Other Zones** | – | – | Enemy forces (Byzantine, German) remain concentrated in their own fronts; no new incursions toward Spanish borders. |
        | **Great Units** | Created: **Great Diplomat** (ID 20369) in Madrid. | – | – |
        | **Unit Promotions** | Paratrooper (ID 19473) promoted *Medic I*. | – | – |
        | **Unit Losses** | Spanish Infantry (ID 19596) killed defending Tiflis. | – | – |
        
        **Summary:**  
        - Spanish land forces have held their positions; only one infantry loss at Tiflis.  
        - No new Spanish naval assets were produced; sea control around Barcelona and Toledo remains firmly in German hands.  
        - German naval expansion continued (new Fleet Destroyer, Anti‑Aircraft Gun) and a German Fighter rebased to Eisenstadt.  
        - Spain’s only strategic gain was the creation of a Great Diplomat in Madrid.

        | **Tiflis** (10390) | ~656 (incl. captured Bomber) | ~881 (Byzantine Light Tank + German Bomber) | **‑** | Even (land) / Enemy (sea) |
        | **Constantinople** (1061) | 0 | ~4,000 (Byzantine Artillery/Machine Guns) | **‑** | Enemy |
        | **Berlin** (1063) | 0 | ~3,800 (German Machine Guns, Krupp Guns) | **‑** | Enemy |
        | **Sea – Barcelona** (‑3336) | 0 (Spanish ships) | ~3,760 (German Fleet Destroyers, Dreadnought) | **‑** | Enemy |
        | **Sea – Tiflis** (‑10390) | 0 (Spanish ships) | ~3,800 (German Battleship, Fleet Destroyers) | **‑** | Enemy |
        
        *Combat Strength (CS) estimates based on unit tables supplied. No significant change in overall balance since Turn 444; Spanish land superiority around core cities persists, while maritime dominance remains German.*

        ### 3. Threat Assessment  
        
        | Threat | Origin | Proximity to Spain | Capability | Current Status |
        |--------|--------|-------------------|------------|----------------|
        | **German Naval Supremacy** | Germany (Fleet Destroyers, Battleship, Dreadnought) | Adjacent to Barcelona & Toledo sea zones | Ability to project amphibious raids, air‑support from carriers | Unchanged; recent German ship promotions increase durability. |
        | **Byzantine Light Tank & Air Units** | Byzantium (Light Tank at Nicomedia, Bomber near Tiflis) | Eastern front near Tiflis | Land‑strike and air‑strike on coastal tiles, threatens Havana‑type tile (Hacienda) | Present; no change. |
        | **Mongolian Anti‑Air/Paratrooper** | Mongolia (Anti‑Air at Beshbalik, Bomber) | Distant – no direct border pressure | Limited to far‑range air attacks, but could support Byzantine actions | No activity near Spanish borders this turn. |
        | **Shoshone Air Activity** | Shoshone (Machine Gun unit, no aircraft) | Coastal western edge, Open Borders | Currently internal; denouncement may not translate to aggression | No incursions observed. |
        | **Uranium Tile Vulnerability** | Hacienda on (40,21) – not yet a uranium resource | Adjacent to Tiflis (coastal) | Susceptible to naval bombardment (German fleet) and air raids (Byzantine bomber) | Tile remains a Hacienda; no uranium secured. |
        
        **Key Risks:**  
        - **Sea‑zone exposure** around Barcelona makes any coastal infrastructure (including Great Works) vulnerable to amphibious assault.  
        - **Tiflis** remains a high‑value target (Manhattan Project) with insufficient anti‑air/anti‑naval defense.  
        - **German naval build‑up** could enable a coordinated amphibious push if Spain cannot field any sea units soon.  
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. Strategic Resources & Projects  
        
        | Project / Resource | Current Status (Turn 449) | Immediate Implications |
        |--------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
        | **Manhattan Project** (Tiflis) | Production at **12 %** (≈ 101 PPT). No change since Turn 444. | Requires ~ 87 more turns at current rate; deadline at Turn 452 → unlikely to finish on time without gold‑purchase acceleration. |
        | **Uranium Tile (40,21)** | Occupied by a **Hacienda** (producing Food/Prod/Gold). No uranium resource present. | Must be cleared and a Builder sent to improve a true uranium node before any atomic weapon can be pursued. Tile is exposed to German naval and Byzantine air threats. |
        | **Gold Reserves** | **2,021 G** (turn 449), G/PT ≈ 586. | Sufficient to purchase multiple turns of Manhattan production (≈ 300 PPT per 1 G). No purchases recorded yet. |
        | **Great Diplomat** (Madrid) | Created this turn (ID 20369). | Can be used to improve relations or negotiate cease‑fires; however, Spain is currently at war with Germany, Byzantium, and Austria, limiting diplomatic leverage. |
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Comparative Snapshot (Turn 444 → Turn 449)
        
        | Metric | Turn 444 | Turn 449 | Δ |
        |--------|----------|----------|---|
        | **Spanish Land Units** | 20 | 20 (no net change) | – |
        | **Spanish Naval Units** | 0 (no ships) | 0 (still none) | – |
        | **German Naval Strength (adjacent sea zones)** | ~4 destroyers | +1 Fleet Destroyer (ID 20339), +1 Anti‑Aircraft Gun | +2 German assets |
        | **Spanish Gold** | 1,317 G | 2,021 G | +704 G |
        | **Gold/Turn** | ≈ 351 G | ≈ 586 G | +235 G/PT |
        | **Manhattan Progress** | 12 % (101 PPT) | 12 % (unchanged) | – |
        | **Uranium Tile** | Hacienda on (40,21) | Same | – |
        | **Great Works / Projects** | None listed | Great Diplomat created | +1 Great Diplomat |
        | **War Weariness (Spain)** | 43 % vs. Germany, 24 % vs. Byzantium, 17 % vs. Austria (as per player data) | Unchanged | – |
        
        **Overall Trend:** Economic capacity has risen sharply, but military balance (especially at sea) remains unfavorable. No progress on the Manhattan Project despite increased gold.  
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. High‑Level Needs & Excesses  
        
        | Category | Current Situation | Assessment |
        |----------|-------------------|------------|
        | **Land Force Strength** | Core cities (Madrid, Barcelona, Toledo) collectively ~6,000 CS, exceeding local enemy strength. | Adequate; no immediate reinforcement required. |
        | **Naval Presence** | 0 Spanish warships; sea zones around Barcelona & Toledo controlled by Germany. | **Deficit** – at least 2 Armada (unique Corvette) units needed to contest German destroyers, plus a coastal defense battery (Anti‑Air or Artillery) to deter amphibious landings. |
        | **Air Defense** | Single Bomber (captured) at Tiflis; no dedicated AA or fighter units near Tiflis. | **Deficit** – add 1 Anti‑Aircraft Gun or rebase a Fighter to Eisenstadt and escort to Tiflis. |
        | **Strategic Resources** | No uranium; only a Hacienda on a non‑uranium tile. | **Critical** – locate and improve a uranium node; protect the tile while construction occurs. |
        | **Gold Surplus** | 2,021 G, ample for production purchases. | **Excess** – can be allocated to accelerate Manhattan Project (buy production) or to fund naval construction (Armada). |
        | **Manhattan Project Timing** | 12 % complete, ~87 turns remaining at current PPT. Deadline Turn 452 (8 turns away). | **Urgent** – must purchase > 250 PPT per turn (≈ 800 G total) to meet deadline; otherwise diplomatic penalty imminent. |
        
        ---
        
        ### 7. Mobility & Evacuation Considerations  
        
        | City | Threat Level | Recommended Action |
        |------|--------------|--------------------|
        | **Madrid** | Low – inland, no immediate sea threat. | Maintain current garrison; consider moving any valuable Great Works to Madrid if threatened elsewhere. |
        | **Barcelona** | High – sea zone enemy‑dominated; possible amphibious strike. | Transfer any high‑value assets (Great Works, wonders) to Toledo or Madrid via Caravans; evaluate building coastal AA batteries. |
        | **Toledo** | Moderate – sea zone still enemy‑controlled, but inland location provides a safe staging point. | Use as evacuation hub for Barcelona; keep garrison ready to repel any landing. |
        | **Tiflis** | High – strategic tile (Hacienda) and Manhattan Project exposed to Byzantine tank and German bomber. | Deploy at least one Anti‑Aircraft Gun and a Fighter (if available) to protect; consider moving the Hacienda (if possible) or re‑working the tile to a fortified improvement. |
        
        ---
        
        ### 8. Diplomatic Context (Non‑Quantitative)  
        
        - **War Status:** Spain is at war with Germany (Score ‑24 %, War Weariness 43 %), Byzantium (Score ‑2 %, Weariness 24 %), and Austria (Score ‑6 %, Weariness 2 %).  
        - **Allied Relations:** Declaration of Friendship with America; Open Borders with Austria (far) and Shoshone.  
        - **Potential Leverage:** The newly created Great Diplomat could be employed to negotiate limited cease‑fires or trade for naval support, but existing war declarations limit diplomatic options.  
        
        ---
        
        **Intelligence Flags – Immediate Attention**  
        
        1. **Naval Deficit** – Build/convert at least two Armada units; prioritize coastal AA to mitigate amphibious risk.  
        2. **Uranium Acquisition** – Scout for uranium deposits; clear Hacienda on (40,21) and assign a Builder.  
        3. **Manhattan Acceleration** – Allocate ~ 800 G to buy production over the next 4‑5 turns to approach the Turn 452 deadline; otherwise expect diplomatic penalty.  
        4. **Air Defense for Tiflis** – Station an Anti‑Aircraft Gun or re‑base a Fighter to protect the Manhattan site.  
        5. **Asset Relocation** – Move any Great Works from Barcelona to interior cities (Toledo/Madrid).

        ## Economy Briefing
        (Produced with your instruction: TURN 449-452 FINAL ECONOMY MONITORING: Track Manhattan Project completion at Tiflis (should finish Turn 450). Monitor any production interruptions from enemy military action. Confirm Electronics research progression. Track Great Person point accumulation - Spaceflight Pioneers expected to trigger soon providing free Great Engineer/Scientist. Monitor treasury growth for any final-turn purchasing opportunities that might affect final score. Report on faith accumulation progress (currently 153/turn, 200 needed for Great Scientist purchase) and whether Great Person acquisition possible before game conclusion.)
        
        **Spain – Economic Briefing (Post‑Turn 449)**  
        *Prepared for Isabella – Turn 449*  
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Treasury & Gold Flow  
        
        - **Gold in Treasury:** **2 021 G** (↑ 704 G since Turn 444) – a strong cash‑injection primarily from the recent influx of trade‑route gold and the recent influx of gold from Austria (≈ 103 G/t from deal #4).  
        - **Gold per Turn (net):** **+586 G/t** (up +235 G/t vs. Turn 444).  
          - **Sources:**  
            - City output: Madrid (+787 G/t), Barcelona (+180 G/t), Toledo (+81 G/t), Tiflis (+27 G/t).  
            - Incoming trade‑route (Karakorum → Madrid) ≈ +8 G/t.  
            - Outgoing trade‑routes (all land) generate ~+70 G/t total.  
            - Deal income from Austria (+103 G/t) and other minor deals.  
          - **Deductions:**  
            - Unit upkeep (23 units) – modestly offset by the *Casus Belli* maintenance discount (‑15 %).  
            - No significant war‑related expenditures this turn.  
        
        **Assessment:** Treasury is healthy; no risk of overflow or shortage in the next few turns.
        
        ---
        
        ### 2. Production & Major Projects  
        
        | City      | PPT (post‑modifiers) | Current Production | Turns Remaining |
        |-----------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
        | **Madrid**| 303 PPT | **Infantry** (completed Turn 452) | 2 |
        | **Barcelona**| 249 PPT | **Machine Gun** (finishes Turn 452) | 1 |
        | **Toledo**| 185 PPT | **Paratrooper → Special Forces** (upgraded this turn) | 1 |
        | **Tiflis**| 103 PPT | **Manhattan Project** (Completes Turn 450) | 1 |
        
        - **Manhattan Project** will finish at **Turn 450** (one turn away). No enemy units are positioned to disrupt the city; Tiflis remains under Spanish control despite a –5 % happiness delta.  
        - **Computers** was researched this turn (turn 449), unlocking *Radar* (already in research) and enabling the *Spaceflight* chain.  
        - **Electronics** is effectively complete with *Computers* now available; the next step, *Radar*, is 19 turns away.  
        
        **Assessment:** No production interruptions expected; all key projects on schedule.
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. Great Person Points & Upcoming Triggers  
        
        - **Great Scientist / Engineer Points:**  **≈ 152 p/t** (derived from Science per Turn 980 × policy multipliers).  
        - **Great Scientist Purchase:** Faith per Turn = 165 → ~**200 Faith** required for a Great Scientist (via Faith purchase). Current Faith reserve is **2 021 F**; therefore a Great Scientist can be bought immediately if desired.  
        - **Spaceflight Pioneer:** With *Computers* completed, the *Spaceflight* tree is unlocked. At current Science output, the “Spaceflight Pioneer” civic will trigger within the next 20‑

        ### 1. World Congress – Current Snapshot (Voting in 4 turns, Turn 453)
        
        | Civilization | Delegates | Victory % | Note |
        |--------------|-----------|-----------|------|
        | **Byzantium** | **40** | **90 %** | Still the clear front‑runner; 5 delegates short of the 45‑delegate win threshold. |
        | **Spain**      | **6** | **13 %** | No change since Turn 444; delegate count remains low. |
        | **Austria**    | **9** | **20 %** | Stable Order‑bloc member. |
        | **Germany**    | **14** | **31 %** | Autocracy bloc, hostile; unchanged. |
        | **America**    | **6** | **13 %** | Order ally, stable. |
        | **Mongolia**   | **7** | **15 %** | Autocracy bloc, still at peace with Spain. |
        | **The Shoshone** | **10** | **22 %** | Critical swing vote; unchanged. |
        | **Other civs** (minor participants) | — | — | Total **VotesNeeded = 44** (unchanged). |
        
        **Active Resolutions** – All previously enacted resolutions remain in force (Casus Belli, Natural & Cultural Heritage Sites, Freedom World Ideology, Open‑Door policies, etc.). No new resolutions have been proposed since Turn 444.
        
        **Pending Proposals (to be voted on Turn 453)**  
        
        | Proposal | Proposer | Effect if Enacted |
        |----------|----------|-------------------|
        | **Repeal: Passport System** | Germany | Removes 50 % tourism boost; no delegate impact. |
        | **Enact: Sanction – Austria** | The Shoshone | Cuts all trade/Corporation links with Austria; 0.5× Warmonger penalty when Spain (or any) wars with Austria. No delegate effect. |
        | **Repeal: German Sphere of Influence – Assur** | Byzantium | Removes a sphere‑of‑influence option; no delegate impact. |
        
        No other proposals are on the agenda; the voting schedule remains unchanged.
        
        ---
        
        ### 2. Delegate Changes Since Turn 444  
        
        | Civ | Delegates (Turn 444) | Delegates (Turn 449) | Δ |
        |-----|----------------------|----------------------|---|
        | Byzantium | 40 | 40 | **0** |
        | Spain     | 6  | 6  | **0** |
        | The Shoshone | 10 | 10 | **0** |
        | Others (Austria, Germany, America, Mongolia) | unchanged | unchanged | — |
        
        **Key observation:** Byzantium’s delegate total has **stabilised** at 40 after the earlier gain; Spain’s delegate count remains static at 6. The Shoshone still hold a solid block of 10 delegates, keeping them the decisive swing factor.
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. The Shoshone – Red‑Line Monitoring (4‑turn horizon to Turn 453)
        
        | Metric | Current Value | Recent Change | Assessment |
        |--------|---------------|---------------|------------|
        | **Defensive Pact** | Active (close) | No change | Stable; obliges Spain to support Shoshone if they are attacked. |
        | **Open Borders** | Active (close) | No change | Stable. |
        | **Declaration of Friendship** | Active (close) | No change | Stable. |
        | **Public/Private Opinion of Spain** | 100 / 100 (friendly) | No change | No deterioration. |
        | **Ideology** | Freedom (opposes Spain’s Order) | No change | Ideological mismatch persists but does not affect bilateral ties. |
        | **Recent diplomatic actions** | Mutual denouncements of each other’s enemies (minor) | No shift | No impact on overall relationship. |
        | **UN/World Congress voting intent** | Unknown – still the main swing vote. | No new intel. | **Risk** – if Shoshone vote with Byzantium, Byzantium reaches 50 delegates (40 + 10) and wins outright. |
        | **Contact with Byzantium** | No reported diplomatic messages, deals, or gifts since Turn 444. | No change. | **Monitor** for any sudden overtures (e.g., joint proposals, trade offers). |
        
        **Bottom line:** The Shoshone remain a reliable ally militarily and diplomatically, but their voting block remains the *single biggest uncertainty* for the upcoming Congress outcome.
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. Ideology & Bloc Dynamics  
        
        | Civilization | Ideology | Bloc | Current Pressure |
        |--------------|----------|------|-------------------|
        | **Spain** | Order | Order bloc (Austria, America) | No ideological pressure reported. |
        | **Austria** | Order | Order bloc | Sanction proposal from Shoshone could strain trade but does not affect ideology. |
        | **America** | Order | Order bloc | Relations with Spain are friendly; no pressure. |
        | **Germany** | Autocracy | Autocracy bloc | Hostile; no ideological overtures. |
        | **Byzantium** | Freedom | Freedom bloc (leading candidate) | No pressure on other civs. |
        | **Mongolia** | Autocracy | Autocracy bloc | No ideological pressure on Spain. |
        | **The Shoshone** | Freedom | Freedom bloc (potential swing) | Ideology mismatched with Spain but diplomatic ties stay strong. |
        
        No new ideological resolutions have appeared; the **World Ideology – Freedom** remains in effect, locking Freedom as the world ideology but leaving individual civ ideologies unchanged.
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Spain‑America‑Shoshone Triangle – Current Status  
        
        - **Spain ↔ America**: Declaration of Friendship, shared Order ideology, open borders – *friendly*.  
        - **Spain ↔ Shoshone**: Defensive Pact, open borders, declaration of friendship – *guarded but cooperative*.  
        - **America ↔ Shoshone**: Open borders, declaration of friendship – *friendly*.  
        
        All three parties maintain mutual diplomatic ties with **no active conflict**. The defensive pact with the Shoshone could obligate Spain to join a war should the Shoshone be attacked (e.g., by Byzantium), potentially pulling Spain into a conflict that pits it against its Order allies (America, Austria). No such conflict has arisen yet, but the risk remains tied to the Shoshone’s voting decision.
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. Spy Activity (Spain → Germany)  
        
        - Spanish agents **Señor X**, **Leon**, **Enrique**, **Esmeralda**, **Alfonso**, **Julio**, **Tercero**, **Inez** are active in German cities (Berlin, Munich, Cologne, Dortmund, Hamburg, Aachen, etc.).  
        - Several have been **detected** (see Turn 444) but remain operational with sizable networks (≈1 000 points each).  
        - No diplomatic fallout has been reported yet, though German hostility toward Spain persists (war, denouncements, espionage penalties).
        
        ---
        
        ### 7. Immediate Diplomatic Risks & Points to Watch  
        
        1. **Byzantium’s delegate lead** – Only four delegates away from the 45‑delegate threshold; any additional delegate gain (e.g., via a new resolution) could secure a win before the Shoshone vote.  
        2. **Shoshone swing** – Their 10 delegates can tip the balance. Watch for any **Byzantium‑Shoshone** diplomatic activity (trade deals, joint proposals).  
        3. **Defensive pact liability** – If the Shoshone are compelled to fight Byzantium, Spain will be forced into that war, potentially clashing with its Order allies (America, Austria).  
        4. **Sanction – Austria** proposal – If adopted, Spain‑Austria trade could be disrupted, weakening the Order bloc.  
        5. **German espionage detection** – Maintains German hostility; could increase Warmonger penalties if Spain later declares war on Germany.  
        
        *No action recommendations are presented; the above items are intended solely for monitoring and strategic weighting.*

        **End of Briefing – Turn 449**
        
        You, Isabella (leader of Spain, Player 3), are making strategic decisions after turn 449.
- replay:
  - system:
    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:

  - decisions:
    - #0:
      - toolName: set-research
      - args:
        - Technology: Nuclear Fission
        - Rationale: Manhattan Project is completing imminently in Tiflis. Unlocking Atomic Bombs is critical to counter Byzantium's overwhelming conventional military (46k vs our 1.6k) and Germany's naval dominance. Nukes provide an asymmetric deterrent and can break enemy stacks. Also unlocks Nuclear Plants to boost production in the Atomic/Information transition.
    - #1:
      - toolName: set-policy
      - args:
        - Policy: Spaceflight Pioneers
        - Rationale: Next policy in 11 turns will complete the Order tree, granting a free Great Engineer and Great Scientist. The GE can rush Apollo Program or a key infrastructure project, while the GS can bulb a critical tech like Robotics or Satellites. This is the strongest long-term science policy available and fits our Spaceship grand strategy.

      - toolName: set-flavors
      - args:
        - Flavors:

          - Spaceship: 70
          - Espionage: 60
        - GrandStrategy: Spaceship
      - rationale: Spain faces existential pressure from Germany and Byzantium while Byzantium nears diplomatic victory. Manhattan completion means we must immediately pivot to nuclear weapons (Nuke 90, UseNuke 40) as an equalizer. We also need to contest German sea control (Naval 50), build air/anti-air parity (Air 50, Antiair 50), and fortify cities (CityDefense 75, Mobilization 75). Tile improvement priority is raised to secure uranium and repair frontline tiles. Spaceship remains a priority but is slightly reduced to 70 to ensure immediate survival comes first.

          - text:  Let me analyze the situation carefully.
            
            **Current State:**
            - Turn 449, playing as Spain (Isabella)
            - Era: Atomic, going into Information
            - Currently at war with Germany, Byzantium, and Austria (though Austria is far away)
            - Austria is actually a friend (DoF, Order ideology) but we're technically at war with them? Wait, looking at relationships... Austria shows "War" but with 0% score and 2% war weariness. Actually in the player summary for Spain, it says "Austria: Distance: Far, Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship". But also "War (Our Score: -6%; Our War Weariness: 2%)". This seems like maybe we're in a war that isn't active or there's some confusion. Actually looking at Player 5 (Austria), their relationship with Spain says "Distance: Far, Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship" - no war mentioned on their side. But on Spain's side it lists War. This might be a bug or outdated. Actually wait - in Spain's relationships: "Austria: Distance: Far, Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship" - it doesn't say War here? Let me recheck. Actually in Player 3's relationships section:
              - Austria: Distance: Far, Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship
              - No war listed! The war relationships are Germany and Byzantium only. The -6% war score must be from something else. Actually looking again: "Austria: Distance: Far, Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship" - correct, no war.
            
            - Strong allies: America (DoF, Order), Austria (DoF, Order)
            - Friendly with: The Shoshone (Open Borders, denounced each other's enemies, but different ideologies)
            - Enemies: Germany (Autocracy, at war, denounced), Byzantium (Freedom, at war, denounced), Mongolia (Autocracy, denounced)
            
            **Key Victory Conditions:**
            - Diplomatic: Byzantium has 40 delegates, needs 44. Byzantium is the clear frontrunner. Voting in 4 turns (Turn 453).
            - Science: No one has completed Apollo. Byzantium has Apollo complete! That's huge. And they have 70 techs vs our 66.
            - Cultural: Austria and Byzantium are influential over 5 civs each. Byzantium is about to win cultural (9 turns to influential over Austria, and 165% over us). Wait, Byzantium is already influential over 5 civs. Need 6 for cultural victory. They need one more - Austria is at 84% popular, 9 turns to influential. But they already have 5. Actually in Civ V, you need to be influential over all civs (or more than half? Let me check... In base Civ V you need to be influential over all civs. In Vox Populi it might be different. The report says "CivsNeeded: 6" in a 7-civ game? Wait, there are 7 major civs listed (The Shoshone, Mongolia, America, Spain, Byzantium, Austria, Germany) but it says CivsNeeded: 6. So you need to influence 6 out of the other 6? Actually "CivsNeeded: 6" means you need to influence 6 civilizations. Byzantium already influences 5 and needs 1 more (Austria in 9 turns). But wait, can Byzantium win cultural? They need two Tier 3 tenets and finish Citizen Earth Protocol wonder. They have Freedom 11 policies, so they likely have Tier 3 tenets. And they have Artistry 6. So yeah, Byzantium is very close to Cultural victory too.
            - Domination: Mongolia controls 25% of capitals.
            
            **My Situation:**
            - Score: 1567 (lowest among majors)
            - 4 cities, population 113
            - Military strength: 1620 (very weak compared to Byzantium's 46,910 and even Germany's 5,043)
            - Gold: 2021, +586 GPT (very strong economy)
            - Science: 980 SPT (decent but behind Byzantium and Austria)
            - Culture: 836 CPT
            - Tourism: 438 TPT (weak for cultural)
            - Current research: Radar (19 turns away)
            - Next policy in 11 turns: Spaceflight Pioneers (Order Tier 3) - already set
            
            **The Immediate Crisis:**
            1. Byzantium is about to win Diplomatic victory in 4 turns if they get 4 more delegates or if voting goes their way. They have 40 delegates, need 44. With World Ideology Freedom, they get +1 delegate, and +1 for each Freedom follower. But actually looking at the World Congress rules, they might need 44 votes to win, and voting happens in 4 turns. If The Shoshone (9 votes) votes for them, they get 49 and win. Also they could get votes from city-state allies? Actually in Vox Populi, once World Ideology is enacted, you can win diplomatic victory by getting enough delegates at the World Congress.
            
            Wait, actually I need to think about whether I can stop Byzantium at all. I have 6 votes. America has 6, Austria 9, Shoshone 9, Germany 14, Mongolia 7. Total is 91? But we need to prevent Byzantium from getting 44.
            
            Actually, looking more carefully: "Byzantium: Delegates: 40, VictoryPercentage: 90". They need 44 to win. If the Shoshone vote with them (9 delegates), that's 49. So if Shoshone vote for Byzantium, Byzantium wins.
            
            But wait - can I actually influence the Shoshone? The Shoshone are Freedom, I'm Order. But we have good relations (defensive pact!).
            
            Actually, I notice: "We have denounced each other!" with The Shoshone? But also "Open Borders", "Declaration of Friendship"? Let me re-read.
            
            In Player 0 (Shoshone) TheirOpinionOfUs:
            - "We have denounced each other!"
            - "If you (Spain) declare war on The Shoshone within the next 3 turns, other civilizations might view you as a backstabber."
            
            In OurOpinionOfThem:
            - "You (The Shoshone) have denounced one of Spain's declared enemies! (11)" 
            - "Spain's real approach to The Shoshone is Guarded."
            - "We are completely untrustworthy to Spain."
            - "You (The Shoshone) have denounced a leader Spain made a Declaration of Friendship with! (-11)"
            - "You (The Shoshone) have chosen to adopt the Freedom Ideology, but Spain believe in Order. (-999)"
            
            So we actually have denounced each other! But we also have Open Borders and are trade partners. This is a complex relationship. The defensive pact might have expired or was never there? Actually looking back at my summary, it says "Our top defensive pact ally: None". So no defensive pact.
            
            Wait, in Shoshone's relationships they list:
            - "Spain: Distance: Close, Open Borders, Denounced Them"
            
            And in Spain's relationships:
            - "The Shoshone: Distance: Close, Open Borders, Denounced Them"
            
            So yes, we have denounced each other. But we still have open borders. That's interesting.
            
            Given that Byzantium has 40/44 delegates and will likely win in 4 turns, what can I do?
            - Use spies to stage coups? I don't see spy options in the tools.
            - Buy out city-states? My economic brief doesn't mention envoys/diplomats.
            - Diplomatically influence Shoshone? They have 9 votes.
            
            Actually wait - the World Congress voting: "Voting in 4 turns". If Byzantium gets 44 delegates, they win. Currently at 40. Delegates come from city-state alliances primarily. If I can prevent them from gaining more city-state allies or flip some, maybe I can stop them? But looking at the city-state section, Byzantium controls Huari, Manila, Sydney, Shedet. Germany controls Warsaw, Kabul, Genoa, Assur. Austria controls M'banza-Kongo. And there are several Open Door policies active which prevent allying.
            
            Honestly, Byzantium seems unstoppable for Diplomatic victory. And for Cultural, they're also extremely close (9 turns to influential on Austria if trends hold, but with 84% and 530% tourism/culture ratio, it's actually 9 turns? No, that's for Austria to become influential? Wait, looking at Byzantium's cultural progress: "Austria: Popular (84%) - Rising (9 turns to Influential, tourism/culture ratio 530%)". Yes, 9 turns.
            
            So Byzantium is about to win either Diplomatic (4 turns) or Cultural (~9 turns). Unless something drastic happens.
            
            What about Science? Byzantium already completed Apollo! So they could go for Science too. But they seem posed for Diplomatic or Cultural.
            
            Given that the game might end soon, what should my strategy be?
            
            Let me reconsider. Is there any way to stop Byzantium diplomatically? In Vox Populi, to win diplomatic victory, you need to be elected World Leader. The vote happens every 20 turns after the UN is built? Or when World Ideology is enacted? Actually with World Ideology: Freedom enacted, the diplomatic victory is enabled.
            
            I don't have many tools to stop Byzantium. But I should focus on my own position. If the game is likely ending, maybe I should maximize my score? Or maybe try for a Science victory if possible? But with 4 cities and low production compared to Byzantium's 13 cities...
            
            Actually, let me look at the Science victory again. Byzantium has Apollo complete! That's the first step. I haven't even started Apollo. So Science is out.
            
            Domination? I have 1620 military strength vs Byzantium's 46,910. No way.
            
            Cultural? My tourism is 438 vs Byzantium's 2220. No way.
            
            Diplomatic? I have 6 delegates. Byzantium has 40. No way.
            
            So winning seems virtually impossible. The best I can do is survive and maximize score, or try to be a nuisance.
            
            Wait, actually looking at the Victory Progress again:
            - Byzantium: ApolloComplete: 1
            - Others: 0
            
            Byzantium is in Information Era, has 70 techs, 13 cities, 359 pop, 46k military. They are absolutely dominant.
            
            Given this situation, what should I do in terms of strategy?
            
            1. Flavors: Keep Spaceship grand strategy? It doesn't matter much. But I should focus on defense since I'm at war with Germany and Byzantium.
            
            Actually, wait. Looking at the military briefing more carefully:
            - Tiflis is building Manhattan Project (12%? Wait the economy briefing says "Manhattan Project (Completes Turn 450)" - that's NEXT TURN! And it says 1 turn remaining. But the military briefing says 12% complete. There's a discrepancy. Actually the economy briefing says Tiflis is producing Manhattan Project and completes Turn 450 (1 turn). The military briefing says 12% complete with 101 PPT and ~87 turns remaining. This is contradictory. Given that the economy briefing is newer and says 1 turn remaining, I'll trust that. Also the military briefing header says it's from Turn 449, same as economy.
            
            Manhattan Project completing next turn would give me access to Atomic Bombs! But I need Uranium. The military briefing says I don't have uranium improved yet. However, with Manhattan completing, I can build nukes if I have uranium.
            
            Actually, if I get nukes, maybe I can use them to slow down Byzantium? Or at least defend myself. Nuclear weapons can be a great equalizer. But I need uranium and the actual bombs.
            
            But wait - the military briefing says Manhattan is at 12%, not completing. The economy briefing says 1 turn. Which is correct? The economy briefing says Tiflis PPT is 103 and Manhattan completes in 1 turn. If Manhattan costs ~1000 production, and Tiflis is 103 PPT, it would take ~10 turns, not 1. So maybe the economy briefing is wrong about "1 turn remaining" and it's actually referring to something else? Or maybe it's a Project that was rushed/bought?
            
            Actually, looking at the economy brief again: "**Tiflis**| 103 PPT | **Manhattan Project** (Completes Turn 450) | 1 |" - This says 1 turn remaining. But with 103 PPT, if it costs 1000+ production, it would take ~10 turns. Unless Tiflis has been building it for 9 turns already and is at 90%+. But the military brief says 12%. It's possible there are multiple "Manhattan Projects" or one of the briefs is outdated. Let me check: Military brief says "Manhattan Project (Tiflis) | Production at 12% (≈101 PPT). No change since Turn 444." No change since Turn 444? That's 5 turns ago. If it was 12% at Turn 444 and hasn't changed, that means production was diverted or it's bugged. But the economy brief says 1 turn remaining. I'll trust the economy brief more for production timing.
            
            Actually, if I look at the top of the economy brief: "Computers was researched this turn (turn 449)" - that matches. And "Tiflis: Manhattan Project (Completes Turn 450)" - 1 turn. So I'll assume it will complete next turn.
            
            If Manhattan completes, I can start building atomic bombs IF I have uranium. The military brief notes "Uranium Tile (40,21) - Occupied by a Hacienda (producing Food/Prod/Gold). No uranium resource present." So I need to find actual uranium.
            
            But the tools don't let me control workers directly - only flavors. I could increase TileImprovement flavor to get workers to improve resources.
            
            Actually, the most important immediate concern is that I'm at war with two stronger neighbors (Germany and Byzantium). I need defense. But I also have a massive gold surplus (2021G, +586 GPT). I should be buying military units or production.
            
            Wait, the prompt says I delegate tactical decisions to the AI. So I need to set flavors that make the AI build what's needed.
            
            Looking at my current flavors:
            - Offense: 0
            - Defense: 80
            - Mobilization: 50
            - CityDefense: 60
            - Nuke: 60
            - UseNuke: 0
            - Naval: 10
            - Air: 20
            - Antiair: 20
            - Production: 100
            - Science: 100
            - Spaceship: 90
            - Infrastructure: 80
            - Gold: 70
            
            These seem pretty good. Defense is high, production and science are high.
            
            But wait - what about the Manhattan Project completing? After that, I should probably research Nuclear Fission to get the Atomic Bomb. Looking at the available technologies:
            - Nuclear Fission
            - Alternative Energy
            - Telecommunications
            - Mobile Tactics
            
            If I set Nuclear Fission as next research, that would let me build Atomic Bombs (after Manhattan). But I need to make sure I have uranium. Actually, the description of Nuclear Fission says: "Allows you to build the Bazooka... and Atomic Bombs... Also allows you to build the Nuclear Plant". And "you must first have completed the Manhattan Project and have Uranium available."
            
            So research path should probably be Nuclear Fission next. But currently I'm researching Radar (19 turns). Nuclear Fission is available immediately as next.
            
            For policies: Next is already set to Spaceflight Pioneers (Order Tier 3). That's good for a science focus. But given that I'm struggling to survive, should I switch? Spaceflight Pioneers gives a free Great Engineer and Great Scientist, and helps with spaceship parts. Since I'm far behind in science, but this policy helps, maybe keep it. But if Byzantium wins in 4 turns diplomatically, it might not matter.
            
            Actually, wait. Can Byzantium really win diplomatically in 4 turns? The vote needs 44 delegates. They have 40. Delegates can change between turns if city-state allegiances change. But in Vox Populi, the World Congress voting happens every 20 turns after founding, and winning requires a majority vote or threshold. "VotesNeeded: 44". If voting is in 4 turns, and they currently have 40, they could get more delegates if they ally with more city-states. Or they could simply get enough votes from other civs if others vote for them.
            
            But actually, the "Delegates" number might be their voting power, not how many votes they'll get. Other civs might vote for them too. So yeah, they're very likely to win.
            
            If the game ends in 4 turns, my research and policy choices for the long term don't matter much. What matters is immediate military survival and perhaps maximizing my score.
            
            But wait - I should not give up. Is there any way to stop them?
            - Could I denounce Byzantium? Already done.
            - Could I declare war on Byzantium? Already at war.
            - Could I capture their cities? They have 46k military strength vs my 1.6k. No.
            - Could I somehow get 44 delegates? No, I only have 6.
            
            Actually, looking at the active resolutions, there's "World Ideology: Freedom". This gives Freedom civs an extra delegate. Byzantium is Freedom. But everyone else's ideology is fixed for now.
            
            Wait, I just realized: the victory progress says "Byzantium: ApolloComplete: 1". In Civ V, Apollo Program is a World Wonder. Once it's built, anyone can build spaceship parts. Having Apollo complete doesn't mean they're close to Science victory - they still need to build 6 spaceship parts (each taking many turns). But given their 13 cities and high production, they could do it.
            
            But Diplomatic is faster (4 turns).
            
            Actually, wait - World Leader votes might not automatically give victory. In base Civ V, you need to win a World Leader election by getting enough delegate votes. If Byzantium has 40 and needs 44, and gets 40 votes, they don't win. They need to reach 44. So if they don't gain delegates, they might not win this round. But World Congress votes happen periodically. They might win on a subsequent vote.
            
            However, the report says "VictoryPercentage: 90" for Byzantium diplomatic. So they're very close.
            
            Given the game situation, I think I should:
            1. Keep defending against Germany and Byzantium
            2. Try to get nukes online as a deterrent/equalizer
            3. Focus on science to maybe catch up if the game continues
            
            Let me set:
            - **set-research**: Nuclear Fission (to unlock Atomic Bombs after Manhattan completes)
              - Wait, will Manhattan complete first? If Manhattan completes in 1 turn (per economy brief), but Nuclear Fission takes ~10 turns to research, then I won't have nukes immediately anyway. But at least I unlock them. Actually, if I have the Great Scientist from Spaceflight Pioneers, or faith-buy a Great Scientist, I could bulb Nuclear Fission later.
              - Alternative: Telecommunications or Mobile Tactics? Telecommunications unlocks The Internet (tourism) and Robotics. Mobile Tactics unlocks Stealth. Nuclear Fission seems most directly useful for war survival with atomic bombs.
              
            - **set-policy**: Keep Spaceflight Pioneers
              - Actually, is there a better policy? Since I'm at war and struggling, maybe a military policy? But I already have 5 Order policies and Spaceflight Pioneers is Tier 3 - very strong. I should probably keep it. The free Great Engineer and Great Scientist are invaluable.
            
            - **set-flavors**: Need to adjust for immediate military needs. Currently I have high Production (100), Science (100), Spaceship (90), Defense (80), Infrastructure (80). I should probably:
              - Increase Nuke and UseNuke (once I have them)
              - Increase Mobilization for more military production
              - Increase Air and maybe Antiair
              - Add some CityDefense
              - Increase Gold? Already 70.
              
              But I should also decrease some things. Currently Spaceship is 90 but if Byzantine wins soon, maybe lower it? However, if the game continues, Spaceship is my only real path. I'll keep Spaceship high but maybe lower it slightly since I need more immediate defense.
            
              Actually, looking at the current situation, I have plenty of gold (2021, +586). I could use gold to buy units instead of producing them, which means I can keep Production focused on infrastructure/Science while using gold for military.
            
              The flavor "UseNuke: 0" should probably be increased so the AI actually uses nukes when I get them. But I don't have them yet. I can set it to a moderate value (30-40) to indicate preparedness.
            
              "Nuke: 60" is decent but maybe increase to 80 to build more.
            
              "Naval: 10" - I have 0 ships and Germany dominates the seas. Should increase to at least 30-40 to build some Armada (my unique Corvette replacing... wait, Corvette is a unit? Actually my UU is Armada replacing Corvette. I should build naval units. But I have no coastal production cities mentioned? Madrid, Barcelona, Toledo, Tiflis. Barcelona and Tiflis are coastal according to the brief. So I can build ships there.
            
              "Air: 20" - increase for fighters/bombers
              "Antiair: 20" - keep or increase
              "Mobilization: 50" - maybe increase to 70
              "CityDefense: 60" - keep
              "Defense: 80" - keep
              
              I should reduce "Infrastructure: 80" a bit since we're in late game and at war. Maybe to 50.
              "TileImprovement: 50" - maybe increase to find/improve uranium? Actually there's a specific callout about uranium. I should prioritize finding and improving it.
            
            Wait, I don't have a specific "StrategicResources" flavor. Uranium improvement would fall under TileImprovement (workers improving tiles) and maybe Recon (to find it). But I probably already know where uranium is (the brief mentions a tile at 40,21 that is currently Hacienda but "no uranium resource present"). So uranium might be elsewhere.
            
            Since I can't directly control workers, increasing TileImprovement might help get workers out to improve uranium if it's known.
            
            Let me think about relationships:
            - Germany: at war, denounced, -40 public. This is fine.
            - Byzantium: at war, denounced, -70 public. Also fine.
            - Mongolia: denounced, -30 public. They haven't attacked me, but they're Germany's ally. I should keep them hostile but maybe not push them into war since I'm already fighting two.
            - The Shoshone: denounced each other but have open borders. Actually in reports: "We have denounced each other!" This is important. My public relationship with Shoshone is set to 0. But the Shoshone haven't attacked me. Given that Byzantium is the real threat, and Shoshone are a swing vote, should I try to improve relations? But we have opposite ideologies (-999) and have denounced each other. It's probably futile. But I also have a defensive pact... wait no, I checked and "Our top defensive pact ally: None". So no pact.
            
            Actually, looking at Player 3 (Spain) MyEvaluations: "Our top friend: America, Our top defensive pact ally: None".
            
            So I don't have a defensive pact with Shoshone. Good.
            
            Given that, I could potentially try to improve relations with Shoshone? But we've denounced each other, which is a severe diplomatic penalty. Probably not worth the effort. They'll almost certainly vote with Byzantium for World Leader.
            
            Wait, what if I set relationship with Shoshone to positive? It might not matter because of the denunciation and ideology difference. But worth a shot? The -999 ideology penalty is impossible to overcome with relationship modifiers.
            
            Let me focus on what I can control.
            
            **Technology choice:**
            - Nuclear Fission: Unlocks Atomic Bombs, Bazookas, Nuclear Plants. This is the clear choice for a civ at war that just completed Manhattan. Rationale: Need nukes to counter superior forces.
            
            **Policy choice:**
            - Spaceflight Pioneers: Already set. It gives free GE and GS. Very strong. Keep it.
            
            **Flavors:**
            - Adjust to focus on surviving the wars and preparing nuclear deterrent.
            - Increase Nuke to 80 (build more nuclear weapons)
            - Set UseNuke to 30 (willing to use them when available)
            - Increase Naval to 40 (build some ships to counter German naval dominance, especially Armada)
            - Increase Air to 40 (more air power)
            - Increase Antiair to 40 (defend against German/Byzantine air)
            - Keep Defense at 80, CityDefense at 60
            - Increase Mobilization to 70 (more military production)
            - Decrease Spaceship from 90 to 70 (still important but immediate survival is key)
            - Decrease Infrastructure from 80 to 60
            - Increase TileImprovement to 70 (to find and improve uranium, also fix tiles)
            - Keep Production 100, Science 100
            - Growth 40, keep
            
            Wait, I should consider whether to use my Great Diplomat or gold to buy influence with city-states? The economy brief mentions a Great Diplomat created in Madrid. But I don't have a tool for that. The in-game AI handles diplomatic units based on flavors. I have Diplomacy at 30. If I want to stop Byzantium diplomatically, I should increase Diplomacy massively to try to flip some city-states? But Byzantium has permanent alliances (Spheres of Influence) with many.
            
            Actually looking at the active resolutions, there are Spheres of Influence that are permanent unless repealed. And Open Door policies that freeze influence at 40. So city-state diplomacy is heavily constrained. I can't really flip city-states under Open Door or Sphere of Influence.
            
            So Diplomacy flavor probably won't help much.
            
            **Relationships:** 
            Should I change any relationships? 
            - Germany: -40, fine.
            - Byzantium: -70, fine.
            - The Shoshone: Currently 0. If I set it to positive, would it help? The report shows we denounced each other and have -999 ideology. It won't matter. But just in case, I could set public to 30 or something? But the tools say these are additive modifiers for the AI's decision making. Since the AI already has massive negative modifiers, adding +30 won't change much. I'll skip this.
            - Austria: 100. Very good, keep it. But do I want to remain at war? Actually we're NOT at war with Austria according to the diplomacy list. The earlier mention might have been an error or Austria was at war with my enemy? Actually looking at Austria's relationships: they are at war with The Shoshone, Mongolia, Germany, and Byzantium. But NOT with Spain. And Spain lists Austria as DoF. So we're not at war.
            - America: 100. Good.
            
            Actually, the status quo for relationships seems fine. I don't need to change them.
            
            **Persona:** Current persona is very friendly (FriendlyBias: 10), not warlike (WarBias: 2), high loyalty (9), high forgiveness (10). This seems reasonable for a defensive science player. I don't think I need to change persona.
            
            Let me finalize my decisions:
            
            1. **set-research**: Nuclear Fission. Rationale: Manhattan Project is nearly complete; Atomic Bombs are the best way for a smaller empire to counter Byzantium's overwhelming military and potentially deter their advances. Also unlocks Nuclear Plants for production.
            
            2. **set-policy**: Spaceflight Pioneers. Rationale: Free Great Engineer and Great Scientist provide immediate value; Great Engineer can rush critical infrastructure or spaceship parts, Great Scientist can bulb key technologies.
            
            3. **set-flavors**: Adjust for wartime survival and nuclear buildup.
               - GrandStrategy: Keep Spaceship
               - Offense: 0 -> 10 (slight offensive capability)
               - Defense: 80 -> 80 (keep)
               - Mobilization: 50 -> 70 (more military production)
               - CityDefense: 60 -> 70 (stronger city defenses)
               - MilitaryTraining: 15 -> 20
               - Nuke: 60 -> 90 (prioritize nuclear weapons)
               - UseNuke: 0 -> 40 (use nukes when available for area denial and breaking stacks)
               - Naval: 10 -> 40 (counter German naval control, build Armada)
               - Air: 20 -> 50 (air parity)
               - Antiair: 20 -> 50 (defend against enemy air)
               - TileImprovement: 50 -> 70 (improve uranium and repair pillaged tiles)
               - Infrastructure: 80 -> 60 (lower priority in wartime)
               - Spaceship: 90 -> 70 (still long-term goal but immediate survival matters)
               - Rationale: Spain faces existential threats from Germany and Byzantium with conventional forces overwhelmed. Manhattan Project completes soon. We must pivot hard to nuclear deterrent, air defense, and naval buildup to survive and maintain relevance. Science and Production remain critical but must be balanced with military survival.
            
            Actually, I should check if there's any reason to keep Infrastructure high. We have 4 cities, we need production connections. But 80 was very high. 60 is still decent.
            
            One more thing: Espionage. My spies are in Germany. The flavors have Espionage at 40. That's fine.
            
            Wait, I just need to make sure I don't set too many 100s or the AI gets confused. But 90, 100, etc. are okay as long as not everything is 100.
            
            Let me also consider: should I change the grand strategy? Conquest doesn't make sense. Culture is impossible. Diplomatic is impossible. Spaceship is the only one that fits. Keep it.
            
            Let me double check my current policy status. I have Order with 5 policies, needing the 6th for Tier 3. Spaceflight Pioneers is Level 3 Tenet of Order. So yes, I can adopt it next.
            
            Wait, do I already have 5 Order policies? Let me count from the report:
            - Hero of the People
            - Academy of Sciences
            - Workers' Faculties
            - Five-Year Plan
            - Peace, Land, Bread
            
            That's 5 policies. So Spaceflight Pioneers is the 6th and will unlock the Tier 3. Correct.
            
            Also, I have completed Tradition (2 policies shown, maybe more?), Fealty (2), Rationalism (2), Statecraft (3), Imperialism (1), Industry (2), Progress (6). So I have many branches open.
            
            One last check: The Shoshone have denounced me and vice versa. But I also see in their opinion: "You (Spain) have made a Declaration of Friendship with one of The Shoshone's enemies!" and "We have denounced each other!". So yeah, relations are bad despite some positive trade modifiers.
            
            I think my plan is solid. Let me write the tool calls.
            
            Wait, I should call `keep-status-quo` OR `set-flavors`. Since I'm changing flavors, I'll call `set-flavors`. I can also call other tools simultaneously.
            
            Tools to call:
            - set-research
            - set-policy
            - set-flavors
            
            Should I call set-relationship for anyone? I don't think it's necessary. The status quo on relationships is fine.
            
            Should I call set-persona? No need.
            
            Let me write the rationales carefully.
            
            Wait, I need to make sure my flavor names match the options exactly. From the options list:
            - Offense
            - Defense
            - UseNuke
            - CityDefense
            - MilitaryTraining
            - Mobilization
            - Recon
            - Ranged
            - Mobile
            - Nuke
            - Naval
            - NavalRecon
            - NavalGrowth
            - NavalTileImprovement
            - Air
            - AirCarrier
            - Antiair
            - Airlift
            - Expansion
            - Growth
            - TileImprovement
            - Infrastructure
            - Production
            - WaterConnection
            - Gold
            - Science
            - Culture
            - Happiness
            - GreatPeople
            - Wonder
            - Religion
            - Diplomacy
            - Spaceship
            - Espionage
            
            Yes, these all match what I plan to use.
            
            One concern: Increasing UseNuke to 40 means the AI has a 40% per-turn probability of launching nuclear strikes when conditions are met. Given I'm behind, I WANT to use nukes. But if I use nukes, I might get heavy warmonger penalties and everyone might hate me. But Germany and Byzantium already hate me and are at war. The Shoshone and Mongolia also don't like me. America and Austria are my friends and probably won't care if I nuke my enemies.
            
            Actually, nuclear weapons have much lower warmonger penalties than conquering cities. And under Casus Belli, warmonger penalties are halved. So using nukes on Germany/Byzantium is fine. I'll set UseNuke: 40.
            
            Wait, the description says "Sets (flavor%) per-turn probability of launching nuclear strikes during war when strategic conditions are met." So 40 means 40% chance per turn. That's pretty aggressive but given my situation, I need the AI to actually use them.
            
            Let me finalize values:
            - Offense: 0 → 15 (accept some casualties to push back)
            - Defense: 80 → 80
            - Mobilization: 50 → 75
            - CityDefense: 60 → 75
            - MilitaryTraining: 15 → 25
            - Nuke: 60 → 90
            - UseNuke: 0 → 40
            - Naval: 10 → 50 (Germany owns the seas around me)
            - Air: 20 → 50
            - Antiair: 20 → 50
            - TileImprovement: 50 → 75 (uranium, repairs)
            - Infrastructure: 80 → 50
            - Spaceship: 90 → 70
            - Production: 100 → keep 100
            - Science: 100 → keep 100
            - Growth: 40 → keep 40
            - Gold: 70 → keep 70
            - Happiness: 60 → keep 60
            - GreatPeople: 50 → keep 50
            - Diplomacy: 30 → maybe keep 30
            - Espionage: 40 → maybe increase to 60? Actually my spies are doing well in Germany. Keep or increase slightly.
            - Culture: 30 → keep
            - Religion: 20 → keep
            - CityDefense already listed
            
            I'll include all the values I'm changing. I'll set ones I'm not changing? Actually the tool says "Only send in values you intend to change." So I should only send changed values.
            
            Changed from current:
            - Offense: 0 → 15
            - Mobilization: 50 → 75
            - CityDefense: 60 → 75
            - MilitaryTraining: 15 → 25
            - Nuke: 60 → 90
            - UseNuke: 0 → 40
            - Naval: 10 → 50
            - Air: 20 → 50
            - Antiair: 20 → 50
            - TileImprovement: 50 → 75
            - Infrastructure: 80 → 50
            - Spaceship: 90 → 70
            - Espionage: 40 → 60
            
            That's a lot of changes but all seem coherent.
            
            Wait, let me reconsider Spaceship: 70. If I lower it too much, will the AI stop building Apollo/SS parts? But I don't even have Apollo yet. Byzantium does. The game might end in 4 turns. If it doesn't, I still need to pursue science. But 70 is still "prioritize" level. So it's fine.
            
            Actually, looking at my tech tree: I just researched Computers, researching Radar. Radar leads to... what? In Civ V, Radar leads to Combined Arms, Computers leads to Robotics, Telecommunications, etc. Actually the tech tree in Vox Populi might be different. Satellite and Advanced Ballistics are mentioned as unlocked by Nuclear Fission.
            
            If Radar is my current research (19 turns), and then I set Nuclear Fission next, that's fine.
            
            One more thing: Should I consider switching policy to something more immediate? What about "Double Agents" (Order L1) for spy points? Or "Patriotic War" for defense? But Spaceflight Pioneers is scheduled and gives a free GS and GE. Those are among the best effects in the game. A free Great Scientist alone is worth ~8000 science at this point? No, bulb value scales. At Atomic/Information era, a GS bulb is probably ~1500-2000 science. Still very valuable. The GE can rush the Apollo Program or a spaceship part. I should keep Spaceflight Pioneers.
            
            Actually wait - can I even adopt Spaceflight Pioneers? It requires 6 Order policies. I have 5. So yes, one more policy and I get it.
            
            Alright, I'll make the calls.
            
            Oh wait, I should check if there's any better relationship move. Germany and Byzantium are my enemies. Mongolia is Germany's ally and denounced me. The Shoshone might vote for Byzantium. What if I try to befriend the Shoshone despite our differences? Setting relationship to 50 public? The AI uses these modifiers. But with -999 ideology and denunciation, +50 is meaningless. I'll skip it.
            
            What about America? We're already at 100. Fine.
            
            What about Austria? 100. Fine.
            
            I'll skip relationship changes.
            
            So final tools:
            1. set-research: Nuclear Fission
            2. set-policy: Spaceflight Pioneers  
            3. set-flavors: as above
            
            Wait, I see that `set-policy` requires the exact policy name. "Spaceflight Pioneers" is listed in options as "Spaceflight Pioneers (Level 3 Tenet of Ideology Order): Spaceflight Pioneers: ..." So the name is "Spaceflight Pioneers".
            
            Similarly, `set-research` requires the exact tech name. "Nuclear Fission" is clearly listed.
            
            Let me write the JSON array with these three tool calls.
          - providerOptions: undefined
        - #1:
          - type: tool-call
          - toolCallId: call_1777228017909_pjif3j4xq
          - toolName: set-research
          - input:
            - Technology: Nuclear Fission
            - Rationale: Manhattan Project is completing imminently in Tiflis. Unlocking Atomic Bombs is critical to counter Byzantium's overwhelming conventional military (46k vs our 1.6k) and Germany's naval dominance. Nukes provide an asymmetric deterrent and can break enemy stacks. Also unlocks Nuclear Plants to boost production in the Atomic/Information transition.

          - toolName: set-policy
          - input:
            - Policy: Spaceflight Pioneers
            - Rationale: Next policy in 11 turns will complete the Order tree, granting a free Great Engineer and Great Scientist. The GE can rush Apollo Program or a key infrastructure project, while the GS can bulb a critical tech like Robotics or Satellites. This is the strongest long-term science policy available and fits our Spaceship grand strategy.

          - toolCallId: call_1777228039583_3hcwhnywm
          - toolName: set-flavors
          - input:
            - Flavors:
              - Offense: 15
              - Mobilization: 75
              - CityDefense: 75
              - MilitaryTraining: 25
              - Nuke: 90
              - UseNuke: 40
              - Naval: 50
              - Air: 50
              - Antiair: 50
              - TileImprovement: 75
              - Infrastructure: 50
              - Spaceship: 70
              - Espionage: 60
            - Rationale: Spain faces existential pressure from Germany and Byzantium while Byzantium nears diplomatic victory. Manhattan completion means we must immediately pivot to nuclear weapons (Nuke 90, UseNuke 40) as an equalizer. We also need to contest German sea control (Naval 50), build air/anti-air parity (Air 50, Antiair 50), and fortify cities (CityDefense 75, Mobilization 75). Tile improvement priority is raised to secure uranium and repair frontline tiles. Spaceship remains a priority but is slightly reduced to 70 to ensure immediate survival comes first.
