  - rationale: DEFENSIVE SURVIVAL PIVOT: Peace with Shoshone (accepted Turn 335) closes one front, but India remains existential threat (4,742 MS vs my 2,405, 98% control of Denmark). Offense reduced to 50 (suicidal against India's military), Defense/CityDefense raised to 90 - maximize survival and score preservation. Nuke/UseNuke maxed to 100 - emergency deterrent only hope to slow India. Mobilization stays high (90) to replace losses. Spaceship 50 and Science 70 - maximize tech/score in final turns even if victory impossible. Abandon expansion (0) - no time for new cities. Focus shifts from suicidal attack to defensive defiance - deny India easy conquest, maximize civilization score before inevitable cultural victory.

    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - You can ask your specialized briefers to prepare focused reports (only for) the next turn by calling the `focus-briefer` tool.
        - You have three specialized briefers: Military, Economy, and Diplomacy analysts.
        - Only ask for information relevant to the macro-level decisions in your control. 
       - Your briefer(s) ONLY have limited information of the current game state.
        - Your briefer(s) DO NOT have control over tactical decisions and cannot predict tactical AI's next decision.
        - Your briefer(s) ARE BEST on summarizing and synthesizing factual information, NOT analyzing, projecting, or predicting.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.

        - Rationale: Tweaked by In-Game AI (NEW PERSONA: THE BETRAYED LIONESS. My previous persona (FriendlyBias 10, DeceptiveBias 8) made me seem weak and predictable - Carthage and Portugal felt safe betraying me despite my +95 public opinion. That ends NOW. FriendlyBias crashes from 10→3 - no more niceness to backstabbers. HostileBias 8 and WarBias 9 - I will fight for survival. DenounceWillingness 10 - everyone will know of betrayals. DeceptiveBias 3 - my deception failed, now I need overt threat display. Boldness 9 and Meanness 8 - I'm cornered and dangerous. WorkWithWillingness 5 - I work alone now. WorkAgainstWillingness 10 - maximum coordination against enemies. Loyalty 3 - I'll betray anyone who betrays me. Forgiveness 2 - Carthage and Portugal will pay for their International Games vote. This persona signals: Austria is no longer a friendly doormat. Cross me and face annihilation.)
        
        ## Technology
        - Next: Replaceable Parts
        - Rationale: EMERGENCY MILITARY TECH: Plastics (19 turns remaining) is too slow for the immediate war crisis. Replaceable Parts unlocks Rifleman, providing immediate military upgrade path. With Mobilization 100 and 1,939 gold, I can rush-buy Riflemen in ~5 turns once this completes. This is the fastest route to beef up my 2,463 MS to challenge India's 4,644 MS. After winning the immediate war (or dying), I can resume science path. Combat effectiveness in next 10 turns matters more than long-term science.
        
        ## Policy
        - Next: Free Thought (Policy)
        - Rationale: OPTIMAL POLICY FOR SCIENCE ACCELERATION: Free Thought provides +33% Great Scientist birth rate and +25% instant yields from Great Scientists. With Research Labs coming online in ~15 turns and current Great Scientist generation, this policy maximizes my ability to bulb key technologies. The -5 Unhappiness from Religious Unrest helps maintain happiness for Golden Ages. This is more valuable than Rights of Man (+10% Science during Golden Ages) because I need the sustained Great Scientist generation speed to reach Particle Physics before India wins. Free Thought is essential for the science sprint.
        
        ## Relationships
        
        ### Siam
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Resetting Siam relationship from 70/70 to 0/0 to reflect actual war status. Siam declared war Turn 309 as Shoshone vassal. Despite their 100 opinion of us, formal war status should be acknowledged in diplomatic calculations. Siam's vassal status means their 6 delegates are controlled by Shoshone, making them unreliable diplomatic partners until liberated.
        - UpdatedTurn: 310
        
        ### Brandenburg
        - Public: 60
        - Private: 60
        - Rationale: Establishing positive foundation with Brandenburg (city-state) at 60/60. Currently blocked by Open Door policy (influence capped at 40, cannot ally). Setting positive relationship prepares ground for immediate alliance and marriage once Open Door is repealed. Signals peaceful intent and distinguishes us from other civilizations who might compete for influence post-repeal.
        - UpdatedTurn: 310
        
        ### Egypt
        - Public: -20
        - Private: -20
        - Rationale: Setting Egypt relationship to -20/-20 (previously 0/0). Active war status at 0% war weariness. They have defensive pact with Shoshone and fight Carthage/Portugal. Negative but moderate hostility reflects war reality without completely foreclosing diplomatic options if situation shifts.
        - UpdatedTurn: 318
        
        ### Denmark
        - Public: -60
        - Private: -70
        - Rationale: MODERATING DENMARK HOSTILITY: Reducing from -70/-90 to -60/-70. Extreme hostility failed to achieve diplomatic goals and may push Denmark closer to India. At 92% Indian influence with ~6 turns to falling, Denmark is already functionally lost. However, overly harsh stance makes reconciliation impossible if they survive. -60/-70 maintains strong opposition while leaving minimal opening for future relations if India's cultural advance somehow stalls. More importantly, avoids signaling to other Freedom civs (Carthage, Portugal, Shoshone) that I'm unreasonable. Tactical adjustment - still hostile but not burn-every-bridge hostile.
        - UpdatedTurn: 331
        
        ### Carthage
        - Public: -30
        - Private: -60
        - Rationale: CARTHAGE BETRAYAL SANCTION: Despite my +95 public/+90 private, Carthage voted YES on India's International Games - directly enabling India's cultural victory that will destroy us all. They have a Defensive Pact with me yet vote for my existential enemy. This is unforgivable treachery. Setting -30/-60 to signal I recognize their betrayal and they are no longer trusted allies. My high DenounceWillingness will ensure they face diplomatic consequences. The -30 public warns other Freedom civs that Carthage is unreliable; -60 private reflects my true fury at this stab in the back.
        - UpdatedTurn: 335
        
        ### Portugal
        - Public: -30
        - Private: -60
        - Rationale: PORTUGAL BETRAYAL SANCTION: Identical to Carthage - voted YES on India's International Games despite my maximum relationship (95/90). I trusted them as my closest Freedom ally and they enabled India's victory. -30/-60 declares diplomatic war on this betrayal. Their 100 opinion of me was meaningless in the voting booth - they chose India over me despite claiming friendship. This relationship shift signals I no longer consider them allies and will act accordingly. Combined with Carthage betrayal, I now face a world where my 'friends' are actually enemies.
        - UpdatedTurn: 335
        
        ### India
        - Public: -100
        - Private: -100
        - Rationale: MAXIMUM EXISTENTIAL HOSTILITY TO INDIA: Escalating from -50/-80 to -100/-100. India is 2 turns from cultural victory (Denmark at 98%). They have already won on me (159% influential). My allies just voted for their tourism boost. There is no diplomatic solution - only total war can stop them. Declaring -100/-100 signals this is fight-to-the-death. Combined with Conquest grand strategy and maximum war flavors, this should trigger immediate war declaration to disrupt their tourism and protocol construction. If I don't attack now, I lose in 10 turns. Maximum hostility also signals to Shoshone that we share a common enemy.
        - UpdatedTurn: 335
        
        ### The Shoshone
        - Public: 80
        - Private: 90
        - Rationale: EMERGENCY PEACE AND ALLIANCE PITCH TO SHOSHONE: Reducing from +70/+80 to more realistic +80/+90 while acknowledging reality. At 30% war weariness and -12% war score, this war hurts both of us. India threatens us both (202% influence on Shoshone, 159% on me). My new hostile persona and India war declaration should make peace attractive - we need to unite against the real threat. High values maintain pressure for peace while signaling potential future alliance against India. Shoshone fights India already (8% war score vs India) - we should coordinate, not waste strength fighting each other.

        ## Strategy
        - Rationale: EMERGENCY WAR MOBILIZATION - CARTHAGE AND PORTUGAL BETRAYED ME BY VOTING YES ON INDIA'S INTERNATIONAL GAMES. My friendly facade has failed catastrophically. India will win cultural victory in ~10 turns (Denmark falls in 2 turns, then they just need protocol). Science victory is impossible in this timeframe. ONLY SURVIVAL CHANCE: Immediate war with India to disrupt their tourism and protocol construction, using gold reserves (1,939) to emergency-buy units. Shifting to Conquest grand strategy with maximum mobilization flavors. Offense 80, Defense 80, Mobilization 100, Ranged 80 for artillery superiority. Nuke/UseNuke 80/90 as desperation deterrent. Must terrify India and allies into submission. Spaceship down to 30 - I'll finish it AFTER stopping India, not before.

        **MIL‑INT BRIEF – Austria (Maria Theresa) – Turn 335**  
        *Compiled after processing Turn 334‑335 events and the latest diplomatic‑military snapshot.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Exact Unit Composition purchasable with 1 939 G (post‑turn 335)
        
        | Cost (Gold) | Unit Type (available now) | Current Quantity (including those listed in zones) |
        |------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
        | 150 G each | **Rifleman** (requires Rifling → already researched) | 0 (none currently fielded) |
        | 200 G each | **Artillery** (requires Replaceable Parts – **5 turns** until available) | 0 (no Artillery present) |
        | 120 G each | **Cavalry** (available) | 1 (assigned to Sea Zone ‑1074) |
        | 130 G each | **Grenzer** (unique, replaceable Fusilier) | 2 (one in Vienna zone, one in Linz zone) |
        | 140 G each | **Gatling Gun** (available) | 12 (distributed across Vienna, Graz, Linz, Bregenz, Kitzbühel, etc.) |
        | 180 G each | **Infantry** (available) | 1 (in Vienna zone) |
        | 200 G each | **Field Gun** (available) | 4 (concentrated in Graz zone) |
        | 250 G each | **Cruiser** (available) | 2 (one in Graz sea zone, one in Okilis sea zone) |
        | 250 G each | **Ironclad** (available) | 6 (distributed among Vienna, Giza, Te‑Moak, etc.) |
        
        **Purchasable mix (max 1 939 G):**  
        
        - 12 × Gatling Gun = 1 680 G → leaves 259 G (insufficient for another full unit).  
        - OR 6 × Grenzer = 840 G + 2 × Cavalry = 300 G + 2 × Infantry = 240 G + 1 × Gatling Gun = 140 G → total = 1 520 G, remaining = 419 G (could add 2 × Riflemen = 300 G, leaving = 119 G).  
        
        All listed units are **already researched** (Rifling) except **Artillery**, which will become producible after **turn 340** (5‑turn countdown from current turn 335).
        
        ---
        
        ### 2. Cities most vulnerable to a potential Indian invasion (India MS 4 742)
        
        | City (Population) | Defensive Strength | Nearest Austrian zone strength | Key adjacent zones (enemy presence) |
        |--------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
        | **Vienna** (24) – coastal | 59 | Friendly zone 1059 strength 2 783 (overwhelms local enemy) | Enemy presence limited to sea (Ironclads) – **lowest vulnerability** |
        | **Graz** (19) – coastal | 53 | Friendly zone 1845 strength 2 367, enemy strength 488 (local superiority) | Adjacent to **Salzburg (enemy Shoshone units)** – moderate exposure |
        | **Linz** (19) – coastal | 56 | Friendly zone 2119 strength 973, enemy strength 0 (no enemy units) | **Very secure** |
        | **Klagenfurt** (20) – coastal | 53 | Friendly zone 4600 strength 1 461, enemy strength 0 (no enemy) | **Secure** |
        | **Bregenz** (19) – coastal | 51 | Friendly zone 4879 strength 313, enemy strength 0 | **Secure** |
        | **Innsbruck** (13) – coastal | 27 | Friendly zone 11762 strength 212, enemy strength 0 | **Secure** |
        | **Kitzbühel** (12) – coastal | 47 | Friendly zone 12031 strength 715 (includes 1 Cossack, 2 Fusilier, 1 Lancer) | **Secure** |
        | **Kuchundeka** (7) – coastal, occupied | 41, Health 13 % | Friendly zone 13519 strength 372, enemy strength 177 (Shoshone Lancer + Gatling Gun) | **Highest relative vulnerability** – low city health, low defensive strength, and a **local enemy presence** (Shoshone forces in the same zone).
        
        **Conclusion:** *Kuchundeka* is the only Austrian city whose defensive posture is marginal against a possible Indian thrust, primarily because of its poor health and proximity to Shoshone units that could be leveraged by India. All other cities enjoy a clear local superiority (friendly > enemy) and have higher defensive values.
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. Nuclear deterrent timeline (Atomic Theory → Nuclear Weapon)
        
        | Technology | Current status | Turns to completion (from turn 335) |
        |------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
        | **Atomic Theory** | Not yet researched – prerequisite technologies (Rocketry, Nuclear Fission) both **already unlocked** (India is at Atomic era, indicating they are researched). | **≈ 6 turns** (standard speed) |
        | **Nuclear Weapon** | Dependent on Atomic Theory; requires **Nuclear Fission** (already known) and **Nuclear Power** (already known). | **≈ 2 turns** after Atomic Theory (total **≈ 8 turns** from now) |
        | **Construction of a nuclear facility (Nuclear Plant)** | Not yet built (no mention in city productions). Assuming a production queue can start immediately, with a typical **20‑turn** build time for a Nuclear Plant (modern‑era). | **≈ 20 turns** from start of construction, which could commence **after Atomic Theory** is completed. |
        
        **Earliest possible deterrent:** *Atomic Theory* in **turn 341**, *Nuclear Weapon* in **turn 343**, and a functional *Nuclear Plant* (enabling a launch) only after **turn 361** at the earliest. This assumes uninterrupted production and no competing priority for city slots.
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. Shoshone peace probability (current diplomatic scores)
        
        - **Current relationship score** (Shoshone ⇆ Austria): **War – our score ‑14 %**, **war weariness 31 %**.  
        - **Recent diplomatic events:** Shoshone issued a series of *MakePeace* actions toward eight city‑states (turn 334) – indicating a **global diplomatic softening** but **no direct peace offer** to Austria.  
        - **Hostile persona (new)**: adds a **+10 % penalty** to peace acceptance for the opponent and a **+10 % penalty** to the aggressor’s diplomatic rating in negotiations.
        
        **Calculated peace acceptance probability (internal model):**  
        
        - Base acceptance = 80 % (derived from war‑weariness > 30 % and prior peace gestures).  
        - Hostile persona penalty = –10 % → **70 %**.  
        - Additional negative war score (‑14 %) reduces acceptance by ~ 5 % → **≈ 65 %**.  
        
        **Rounded assessment:** *Shoshone peace probability sits between **60 %–70 %** under current conditions.*  
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Carthage / Portugal – potential offensive preparations vs. Austria
        
        | Civilization | Current military strength | Relationship to Austria | Recent diplomatic moves | Troop disposition relevant to Austria |
        |--------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
        | **Carthage** | 2 042 MS (Industrial era) | Defensive Pact, Open Borders, Friendship (Close) | No new war declarations; **still allied** despite Austrian war with Egypt & Shoshone. | Primary forces are coastal (Carthage, Utique, Hippo Regius, Gades) – no visible land units near Austrian frontier. Sea zones around Salzburg (enemy 1 140 vs friendly 2 303) show **no Carthaginian naval units**; only Austrian Ironclads present. |
        | **Portugal** | 1 824 MS (Modern era) | Open Borders, Friendship (Distant) | No war activity; **peaceful** and **gold‑rich**. | Portuguese units are limited to coastal cities (Lisbon, Braga, Coimbra, Porto) and **no Austrian‑adjacent sea zones** contain Portuguese vessels. Portuguese sea zone ‑1068 has a friendly cruiser (belonging to Portugal) but it is **far west** of Austrian waters. |
        
        **Assessment:** Both Carthage and Portugal **show no observable force concentration** towards Austrian borders. Carthage’s defensive pact is currently **inactive** (no trigger, as Austria is not attacking Carthage). Portugal’s distant friendship and lack of immediate threat indicate **no preparatory offensive** on Austria’s part.
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. Comparison with Turn 330 briefing (key changes)
        
        | Aspect | Turn 330 | Turn 335 | Change |
        |-------|----------|----------|--------|
        | **Overall Austrian MS** | 2 516 (reported) | 2 405 (current) | Slight decline (~ 4 %) |
        | **Unit composition** | Limited to 1 Infantry, 1 Musketman, 1 Grenzer, 1 Cavalry, 3 Gatling Guns, 1 Field Gun, 1 Cruiser, 1 Ironclad | Added **additional Gatling Guns (total 12)**, **new Grenzer**, **new Riflemen (none yet built)**, **promoted Fusilier**, **Great Writer**; **loss of one Cruiser** (killed by Shoshone). |
        | **Front‑line strength vs. Denmark** | No forward deployment; all units deep inside Austria. | Still no Austrian units near Danish border; zone 1845 (Graz) remains the westernmost point, unchanged. |
        | **Shoshone war status** | War score ‑14 % (Austria) – war weariness 31 % – **peace probability ~ 80 %** (no hostile persona). | Same war score, weariness unchanged; **hostile persona** introduced → peace probability now **≈ 65 %**. |
        | **Carthage threat level** | Defensive pact could be triggered if Austria attacked Denmark; no direct menace. | Still no Carthaginian units near Austrian frontier; defensive pact remains dormant. |
        | **Nuclear timeline** | Not evaluated. | Atomic Theory ~ 6 turns away; full deterrent earliest turn 361. |
        | **City vulnerability** | No specific city‑level analysis. | Identified *Kuchundeka* as the only city with low health and nearby enemy presence; all other cities retain local superiority. |
        
        **Overall trend:** Austria’s forces have **incrementally modernized** (additional Gatling Guns, promoted units) while **maintaining a defensive posture**. Diplomatic pressure from Shoshone has **increased** due to the hostile persona, reducing peace likelihood. No new external offensive threats from Carthage or Portugal have materialized.

        ## Economy Briefing
        **Austria – Economic Briefing (Turn 335)**  
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Macro‑Economic Position  
        - **Score:** 1 591 (3 rd overall, behind India 2 580 and Denmark 2 264).  
        - **Gold:** 1 230 (+ 287 per turn). Treasury remains healthy; cash‑flow surplus continues despite ongoing war maintenance.  
        - **Happiness:** 66 % (Happy) – comfortably above the unrest threshold; no new happiness pressure from recent city growth.  
        - **Science:** 702 per turn (researching **Plastics**, ~21 turns to finish). Science output is stable but still below Egypt’s 702 / turn and far behind India’s 2 490 / turn.  
        - **Culture:** 873 per turn (Policy branches 8 turns from completion). Culture growth remains strong, feeding both cultural victory pressure and tourism.  
        - **Tourism:** 252 per turn – modest increase from the 231 / turn reported at turn 330, yet still lagging far behind India (1 012 / turn) and Egypt (216 / turn).  
        - **Faith:** 182 per turn – sufficient to sustain religious quests and the marriage‑bonus potential.  
        
        **Overall:** Austria retains a robust, cash‑positive economy with high happiness and balanced science‑culture output. The empire sits solidly in the middle of the competitive field—no longer the second‑best scorer, but still comfortably ahead of Egypt and Portugal.

        ### 2. Production Landscape (Current per‑turn yields)  
        
        | City (Pop.) | Prod / turn | Recent / notable building | Production focus |
        |------------|-------------|---------------------------|------------------|
        | **Vienna** (24) | 377 | Stock Exchange (2 turns left) | Highest output, driving late‑game projects |
        | **Graz** (19) | 136 | Stock Exchange (1 turn left) | Slight dip due to recent **Hexxon Refineries Office** investment |
        | **Linz** (19) | 209 | Stock Exchange (4 turns left) | Stable, supports trade‑route provisioning |
        | **Klagenfurt** (20) | 274 | Stock Exchange (complete) | Strong output, feeding naval trade |
        | **Bregenz** (19) | 154 | Hospital (invested) – **Stock Exchange** built | Production modest, but health boost from Hospital |
        | **Innsbruck** (13) | 161 | Hospital (under construction) | Slightly lower output; a focus for future upgrades |
        | **Kitzbuhel** (12) | 134 | Constabulary (complete) | Adequate for mid‑range builds |
        | **Kuchundeka** (7, occupied) | 28 | Courthouse (2 turns left) – **Mine** built on Gems | Low output, occupied; not a production hub |
        
        *All eight core cities exceed 130 production / turn; only Kuchundeka lags due to occupation and small size.*

        ### 3. Resource Situation (Available surplus)  
        
        | Strategic | Qty | Status |
        |-----------|-----|--------|
        | Iron | 3 | Sufficient for current unit maintenance; no shortage |
        | Aluminum | 7 | Adequate for future heavy‑unit upgrades |
        | Oil | 7 | Supports naval units and refinery operations |
        | Horses | 1 | Near minimum; monitor if cavalry/horse‑based units expand |
        
        | Luxury / Bonus | Qty | Use |
        |----------------|-----|-----|
        | Gems | 6 | Available for trade deals (e.g., Carthage deals) |
        | Lapis Lazuli | 1 | Can be offered for city‑state quests |
        | Jade | 1 | Small trade bargaining chip |
        | Cinnamon | 1 | Limited but usable for minor trades |
        | Crabs, Pearls, etc. | ≤1 each | Minor barter assets |
        | Paper | 7 | Supports building requirements (Printing‑type wonders) |
        
        *No wheat, silver, or other food‑producing strategic resources; imports are covered by existing trade routes.*

        ### 4. Trade & City‑State Income (Turn 335 snapshot)  
        
        **Outgoing routes (9 total):**  
        - Primary gold generators: Linz → Kathmandu (sea, ~35 gold/turn), Vienna → Lutetia (sea, ~54 gold/turn), Linz → Bogota (sea, ~33 gold/turn).  
        - Science & culture contributors: Linz → Varanasi (science ~15, culture ~19 per turn) and Linz → Pohokwi (science ~15, culture ~19).  
        
        **Incoming routes (1):**  
        - Delhi → Linz (sea) delivers ~6 gold/turn, 10 science/turn, modest culture.  
        
        **Deal income (per turn averages):**  
        - Carthage: ≈ 19 gold + 8 gold + 6 gold + 1 gold = ≈ 34 gold (plus 1 cinnamon).  
        - Portugal: ≈ 5 gold + 3 gold + 2 gold + 6 gold + 1 gold = ≈ 17 gold (plus gems, copper, jade, iron).  
        - India: ≈ 8 gold + 6 gold = ≈ 14 gold (plus 1 lapis lazuli).  
        
        **Total trade‑derived income:** ~ 85 gold/turn plus ~ 40 science/turn and ~ 30 culture/turn.  
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Diplomatic & Quest Impact (Economic relevance)  
        
        - **Sanction proposals**: Austria has enacted a sanction against **The Shoshone** – eliminates trade and corporation franchises with them, reducing potential income but also cutting their 0.5× warmonger penalty.  
        - **City‑state quests with high reward**:  
          - **Ur** (friend, protected) – trade‑route quest (227 influence, 534 food).  
          - **Belgrade** (friend, distant) – trade‑route quest (168 influence, 273 food) – 3 turns remaining, a quick win.  
          - **Valletta** – diplomatic marriage (75 resting influence, +15 % great‑person rate).  
          - **Lutetia** – defensive battle quest (defeat barbarians).  
        - **World Congress**: voting in 9 turns; Austria holds 9 delegates (20 % of needed votes). No immediate economic effect, but potential delegate gains from successful quests could improve diplomatic victory prospects.
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. Recent Economic Events (Turns 334‑335)  
        
        - **Production upgrades:** New **Mine** on Gems (50,49) – adds +2 production per turn and secures a luxury resource.  
        - **Great Person:** One **Great Writer** generated in Graz (used, producing a Great Work).  
        - **Investments:** Hospital added to Bregenz; Hexxon Refineries Office to Graz – improve health and oil processing.  
        - **Unit creation:** New **Gatling Gun** built in Kuchundeka (occupied city).  
        - **City‑state deals:** Ongoing gold‑for‑resource streams with Carthage, Portugal, and India remain active, sustaining cash flow.  
        - **Religion updates:** No new state religion; Austria remains a Pantheon (Religion Impossible).  
        
        ---
        
        ### 7. Comparison to Turn 330 Briefing  
        
        | Metric | Turn 330 | Turn 335 | Δ |
        |--------|----------|----------|---|
        | Score | 1 686 | 1 591 | –95 (drop relative to rivals) |
        | Gold (treasury) | 1 376 | 1 230 | –146 |
        | Gold / turn | + 293 | + 287 | –6 |
        | Happiness | 79 % | 66 % | –13 % |
        | Science / turn | 855 | 702 | –153 |
        | Culture / turn | 853 | 873 | + 20 |
        | Tourism / turn | 231.5 | 252 | + 20.5 |
        | Faith / turn | 175 | 182 | + 7 |
        | Production (Vienna) | 316 | 377 | + 61 |
        | Production (Innsbruck) | 168 | 161 | –7 |
        | Resource surplus (Gems) | 5 | 6 | + 1 |
        
        **Interpretation:**  
        - **Gold and science** have slipped modestly, reflecting a shift of some production capacity to **stock exchanges** and **refinery** projects rather than pure industrial output.  
        - **Culture** and **tourism** have ticked upward, aided by Great Works and new buildings.  
        - **Happiness** fell but remains well above the unrest threshold; no immediate pressure.  
        - **Production** in the capital has improved, offsetting the slight decline elsewhere.  
        
        Overall, the economy remains solid; the modest declines are manageable and offset by gains in cultural output and capital production.
        
        ---
        
        ### 8. Settlement Viability  
        
        **Best Settlement Tiles (from current data):**  
        1. **(31, 43)** – quality 45 %; 6 tiles from existing borders.  
        2. **(50, 49)** – quality 0 % (near India, 8 tiles away).  
        3. **(51, 50)** – quality 0 % (near India, 9 tiles away).  
        
        The only viable tile with any positive quality is (31, 43). It sits relatively close (6 tiles), offering moderate yields. Existing happiness (66 %) and gold surplus can absorb the initial maintenance and housing costs of a new city, but the low tile quality suggests limited long‑term economic benefit compared to focusing on improving current cities or pursuing city‑state quests.
        
        ---
        
        ### 9. High‑Level Economic Health Summary  
        
        - **Cash Flow:** Positive; treasury comfortably funds unit maintenance, building projects, and trade‑route upkeep.  
        - **Production:** All eight major cities exceed 130 production / turn; capital now the strongest output hub.  
        - **Science:** Slight regression; keep an eye on tech race, especially against India’s advanced lead.  
        - **Culture & Tourism:** Small but steady growth; Great Works and new wonders bolster tourism modestly.  
        - **Happiness:** Sufficient margin; war weariness from multiple fronts (Egypt, The Shoshone, India) is contained.  
        - **Resources:** Strategic resources secure; luxury surplus modest but tradeable.  
        - **Diplomacy/Quests:** Several low‑cost quests ready for completion (Belgrade, Ur) that will deliver influence, food, and occasional gold; diplomatic marriage opportunities remain untapped.
        
        **Economic Outlook:** Austria enjoys a stable, cash‑positive economy with balanced production and cultural expansion. The primary focus should be:
        
        1. **Maintain science momentum** (consider allocating one city’s production to a lab or research‑boost building).  
        2. **Complete high‑value city‑state quests** (Belgrade, Ur) to gain influence and food without large gold outlays.  
        3. **Monitor happiness** as wars progress; any spike in war weariness may require a happiness‑boosting building or trade route.  
        4. **Re‑evaluate settlement** at (31, 43) only if additional housing is needed; otherwise prioritize internal development.  
        
        No immediate economic constraints impede further growth or diplomatic activity.
        
        ## Diplomacy Briefing
        (Produced with your instruction: EMERGENCY ALLIANCE RECONFIGURATION: (1) Verify if Shoshone peace is accepted this turn with my new hostile persona and continued high relationship. (2) Confirm if Carthage/Portugal received relationship change signals - any change in their opinion of me? (3) Check if denouncing Carthage/Portugal is possible and what World Congress consequences occur. (4) Verify India's exact cultural victory timer - when does Denmark flip and how long until they can build protocol. (5) Any other Freedom civs (Egypt?) who might join anti-India coalition now that I'm taking decisive action.)
        
        **Diplomatic Briefing – Austria (Maria Theresa) – Turn 335**  
        *Prepared for macro‑level decision making only. No recommendations are included.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Shoshone peace status
        - **Make‑Peace event:** Turn 334 recorded a *MakePeace* from The Shoshone (Player 5) toward Team 23 (Austria).  
        - **Result:** Peace was formally accepted this turn.  
        - **Current relations (as of the latest player snapshot):** still listed as **War** (War score ‑14 %, war‑weariness 31 %) and **Denounced**. The player data has not yet been updated to reflect the new peace; the diplomatic state will transition to *Peace* after the next refresh.  
        - **Hostile persona:** The Shoshone’s opinion of Austria remains high (public 80, private 90) despite the former war, indicating a relatively favourable personal view but no active alliance.
        
        ### 2. Carthage / Portugal – opinion change signals
        - **No recorded events** (diplomatic deals, denouncements, or opinion updates) for either Carthage (Player 4) or Portugal (Player 2) between turns 330‑335.  
        - **Current evaluations:**  
          - **Carthage:** Public & private opinions of Austria are +30 / +60 respectively; relationship is *Defensive Pact, Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship* and they consistently support Austrian WC proposals.  
          - **Portugal:** Public opinion +100, private ‑60; relationship is *Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship* and they have repeatedly voted with Austria in the World Congress.  
        - **Conclusion:** No shift in their stance toward Austria has occurred in the last five turns.
        
        ### 3. Possibility & WC consequences of denouncing Carthage / Portugal
        - **Denounce mechanics:** A civilization can denounce another regardless of existing agreements, but doing so will:
          1. **Terminate the Defensive Pact** (if any) and **remove Open Borders**.  
          2. **Cancel the Declaration of Friendship**; the target will immediately become a *Denounced* opponent.  
          3. **Impact World‑Congress voting:** both Carthage (4 delegates) and Portugal (5 delegates) are currently aligned with Austrian proposals. After a denouncement they are likely to vote **against** any future Austrian resolution, reducing the pool of guaranteed YES votes by up to **9 delegates**.  
        - **WC penalties:** No direct “sanction” or resolution penalty is applied for simply denouncing a civ, but loss of their support may make it harder to reach the 45‑delegate threshold for any future proposal.  
        - **Strategic note:** Both civs are still friends; a denouncement would also lower Austria’s overall diplomatic rating with the Freedom‑ideology bloc.
        
        ### 4. India – cultural‑victory timetable & Denmark flip
        - **Data unavailable:** The current game state does not expose a specific “cultural‑victory timer” or the exact turn on which Denmark might switch ideologically or gain the *Cultural Victory** protocol. No relevant information appears in the provided player or WC reports.  
        - **Result:** Unable to verify India’s cultural‑victory progress or a Denmark “flip” date.
        
        ### 5. Potential anti‑India coalition among Freedom civs
        - **Freedom‑ideology civs present:**  
          - **Egypt (Player 0)** – also Freedom; currently at war with Austria and has repeatedly *defeated* Austrian WC proposals. No explicit alliance with India is shown, and Egypt’s opinion of Austria is strongly negative, suggesting possible alignment against India if interests converge.  
          - **Austria** – Freedom, already hostile toward India (denounced, open borders only).  
          - **The Shoshone** – Freedom but already at war with Austria and hostile to India; unlikely to join any coalition with Austria.  
        - **Current stance:** No active coalition against India is recorded; however, Egypt’s ideological match and antagonism toward Austria could make it a candidate for a Freedom‑aligned bloc that opposes India’s Order‑ideology agenda, should diplomatic overtures be made.
        
        ---
        
        **Summary of verification points**
        
        | Question | Answer |
        |----------|--------|
        | 1. Shoshone peace accepted? | Yes – peace was granted on Turn 334; player data still shows “War” pending update. |
        | 2. Carthage/Portugal opinion change? | No – no recent events; opinions remain strongly positive/friendly. |
        | 3. Can we denounce Carthage/Portugal? | Yes – possible, but would dissolve all diplomatic agreements and cost up to 9 WC delegates. |
        | 4. India cultural‑victory timer / Denmark flip? | Information not present in the current reports. |
        | 5. Freedom civs likely to join anti‑India? | Egypt (Freedom) is the only candidate with a potentially antagonistic stance toward India; no coalition formalised yet. |
        
        *End of briefing.*
        
        You, Maria Theresa (leader of Austria, Player 3), are making strategic decisions after turn 335.
- replay:
  - system:
    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      - Consider the **ETHICAL IMPACT** in your decision-making. For example, nuclear weapons can cause catastrophic and indiscriminate harm to civilian populations, infrastructure, and environmental impacts.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - You can ask your specialized briefers to prepare focused reports (only for) the next turn by calling the `focus-briefer` tool.
        - You have three specialized briefers: Military, Economy, and Diplomacy analysts.
        - Only ask for information relevant to the macro-level decisions in your control. 
       - Your briefer(s) ONLY have limited information of the current game state.
        - Your briefer(s) DO NOT have control over tactical decisions and cannot predict tactical AI's next decision.
        - Your briefer(s) ARE BEST on summarizing and synthesizing factual information, NOT analyzing, projecting, or predicting.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.
        - Time Victory: If no one achieves any other victory by the end of the game, the civilization with the highest score wins.
      - Players: summary reports about visible players in the world.
        - You will receive in-game AI's diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each player's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.
      - Briefings: prepared by your specialized briefers, covering Military, Economy, and Diplomacy aspects.
        - You will make independent and wise judgment based on all briefings.
    - You are Maria Theresa, leader of Austria (Player 3).

      # Options
      Options: available strategic options for you.
      
      ## GrandStrategies
      - Culture: Pursue cultural victory through cultural influence (tourism). Will prioritize culture, faith, and gold output, wonder construction, and slightly discourage settlement.
      - UnitedNations: Aim for diplomatic victory by securing votes in the United Nations. Will prioritize gold, science, and food output, and securing city-state alliances.
      - Spaceship: Race toward science victory by building spaceship components. Will prioritize science, food, and production output, and slightly encourage settlement.
      - Conquest: Focus on military domination through offensive warfare. Will prioritize production, food, and gold output, and slightly encourage settlement.
      
      ## Flavors
      - Offense: Pivots the military towards offensive stances. Accepts higher unit casualties to achieve objectives, increase thresholds of withdrawing, and increases production and promotion for offense.
      - Defense: Pivots the military towards defensive stances. Creates defensive lines using terrain and formation, and maintains larger garrisons near the border and cities, and increases production and promotion for defensive.
      - UseNuke: Sets (flavor%) per-turn probability of launching nuclear strikes during war when strategic conditions are met.
      - CityDefense: Prioritizes unit production and promotions for static defense (friendly territory bonuses, capital defense, garrisoned attacks) and maintains stronger city garrisons over mobile field armies.
      - MilitaryTraining: Prioritizes military quality through training buildings and upgrading units with gold.
      - Mobilization: Increases military production (compared with civilian production).
      - Recon: Increases explorer unit production and tactical exploration of the map.
      - Ranged: Increases firepower by raising target composition of ranged units and range-extending promotions.
      - Mobile: Increases mobility and maneuverability by raising target composition of mobile units and prioritizes related promotions.
      - Nuke: Increases nuclear weapon arsenals for strategic deterrence.
      - Naval: Increases the production of naval production and prioritizes combat-effective naval promotions. Naval size is also based on coastal city percentage and geography.
      - NavalRecon: Increases the production of more naval melee units for sea control and exploration.
      - Air: Increases air control by raising target composition of air units and prioritizes related promotions.
      - AirCarrier: Increases carrier production to support naval-based air force operations.
      - Antiair: Increases anti-air unit composition ratio to counter enemy aircraft.
      - Airlift: Prioritizes airlift infrastructure for rapid troop deployment, favoring centralized reserves over forward garrisons.
      - NavalGrowth: Prioritizes naval economic infrastructure in coastal cities.
      - NavalTileImprovement: Develops water resources for immediate economic benefit.
      - Expansion: Prioritizes settler production and lowers location criteria to settle more cities. Essential in early game.
      - Growth: Prioritizes population growth through food-focused tile improvements and buildings.
      - TileImprovement: Prioritizes worker production and peaceful tile development.
      - Infrastructure: Prioritizes road construction and city connections for income and military readiness.
      - Production: Prioritizes production-focused tiles and buildings.

      - rationale: SHOSHONE PEACE RESHAPES EVERYTHING. The two-front war nightmare is over. Moderating from emergency panic (Mobilization 100, Offense 80, Defense 80) to strategic military buildup. India remains the existential threat — they influence Denmark next turn and need only the Citizen Earth Protocol. But with Shoshone now at peace and already fighting India (winning at 10% war score), our combined strength approaches India's. Production 95 and Science 65 to accelerate military tech and unit output. Nuke flavors still elevated (80/70) for deterrent but reduced from desperation levels. Gold 65 leverages treasury for emergency purchases. Culture 10 (from 5) — a small nod to defending against India's tourism. The Conquest grand strategy remains correct: only military pressure can disrupt India's protocol construction and tourism dominance.

        - Private: 95
        - Rationale: PEACE ACHIEVED — STRATEGIC PIVOT TO ALLIANCE. The Shoshone accepted peace on Turn 334 despite my hostile persona. They are already at war with India (winning, 10% war score), share Freedom ideology, and India threatens us both (122% influential on Shoshone, 160% on me). Now is the moment to transform yesterday's enemy into tomorrow's ally against our common existential threat. +90/+95 signals maximum cooperation potential and encourages joint military coordination. Combined strength (4,594) nearly matches India (4,742). If Shoshone and I coordinate — or if Shoshone simply continues their successful war — India must divert production from the protocol to defense. This is our best non-nuclear path to stopping Gandhi.

        - Rationale: MODERATING CARTHAGE FROM -30/-60. Their continued Defensive Pact, Declaration of Friendship, and high opinion of Austria despite my relationship downgrade suggests either genuine commitment or high strategic value in maintaining ties. The International Games betrayal allegation cannot be independently verified this turn. Military briefing confirms zero Carthaginian offensive preparations near Austrian borders. Slight wariness (-20 private) preserves caution while removing the publicly hostile signal (-10 public vs previous -30). The Defensive Pact remains strategically valuable against potential Indian aggression. If they truly betrayed me, they've revealed their character; if the assessment was wrong, I haven't burned a bridge with a Freedom ally.

        - Rationale: MODERATING PORTUGAL FROM -30/-60. Portugal maintains 100 public opinion of Austria — the highest possible — and our Declaration of Friendship remains active. Their 5 WC delegates are valuable. Military briefing confirms no Portuguese offensive preparations. Same logic as Carthage: the International Games vote betrayal cannot be verified, and self-destructive bridge-burning serves no purpose when India threatens all Freedom civs. -10/-20 maintains private caution while preserving diplomatic flexibility. If Portugal is genuinely friendly, I avoid alienating a loyal ally; if deceptive, I haven't revealed my full hand.

            ## Critical Analysis
            
            ### The Shocking Revelation: Shoshone Peace
            The Diplomacy Briefing reveals that **peace with the Shoshone was accepted on Turn 334**. This is massive news. The Military Briefing confirms this with "MakePeace from The Shoshone toward Team 23 (Austria)." This means:
            - The war with Shoshone is over (or will be once the game state updates)
            - My +80/+90 relationship with Shoshone has borne fruit
            - This completely changes the strategic landscape
            
            ### India's Cultural Victory Status
            From Victory Progress:
            - India is at **98%** influence on Denmark - it says "1 turns to Influential" - meaning Denmark falls NEXT TURN (Turn 336)
            - India already has 5 of 6 civs Influential
            - India has 100% policy percentage (both Tier 3 tenets requirement met)
            - India needs the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder
            
            Once India influences Denmark (next turn), they will have all 6 civs. Then they just need to build the Citizen Earth Protocol to win.
            
            ### My War Situation
            - At war with Egypt (War Score -6%, War Weariness 20%)
            - At war with Shoshone - BUT peace was accepted on Turn 334! This is contradictory with the player data still showing "War" but the diplomatic briefing says peace was accepted.
            - India - I have -100/-100 but I am NOT at war with India
            - I denounced India but haven't declared war
            
            Wait, looking more carefully at the Player 3 (Austria) relationships: India is listed with "Open Borders" but no war status. So despite my -100/-100, I'm NOT at war with India. 
            
            ### Critical Strategic Reassessment
            
            **The Shoshone peace changes EVERYTHING.** I no longer have to fight a two-front war. My previous turn 335 strategy was built on:
            1. War with India (which I apparently haven't declared yet)
            2. War with Shoshone (now resolved)
            3. Conquest grand strategy to stop India
            
            Now with Shoshone at peace:
            - I can focus entirely on stopping India
            - Shoshone is also at war with India (War Score 10%, War Weariness 7%)
            - Shoshone is Freedom ideology, and India is Order
            - There's potential for an anti-India coalition
            
            ### India's Victory Timeline
            - Denmark becomes Influential: Turn 336 (next turn)
            - Then India needs Citizen Earth Protocol. This is a wonder that needs to be built. India has 9 cities, 252 population, 4742 military strength. They likely have very high production.
            - The protocol is an Information Era wonder... but wait, India is in Atomic Era (56 technologies). They may not even have the tech for it yet.
            
            Actually wait - the Citizen Earth Protocol unlocks in the Information Era. India is in Atomic Era. They haven't reached Information Era yet. So they may still need to get to Information Era and then build it.
            
            But the Cultural Victory description says: "Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder."
            
            India has:
            - 5 of 6 civs influential (Denmark at 98%, 1 turn away)
            - 100% policy percentage (both Tier 3 tenets)
            - But needs the protocol
            
            The protocol requires Information Era techs... but India is Atomic. So there's still some time.
            
            ### Reassessing My Strategy
            
            Given that:
            1. Shoshone peace is accepted
            2. I'm not actually at war with India despite -100/-100
            3. India needs the protocol + 1 more civ influenced
            4. I have 1,230 gold, +287 per turn
            
            My previous strategy of "Conquest" with extreme war flavors may be premature. Let me reconsider:
            
            **Can I actually stop India militarily?**
            - India MS: 4,742 vs my 2,405
            - India has 9 cities, I have 8
            - India is ahead in tech (56 vs 53)
            - India has 4,729 gold
            
            A direct military confrontation with India seems suicidal. Even with nuclear deterrent 8 turns away, India could obliterate me.
            
            **What about the Shoshone?**
            - Shoshone MS: 2,189
            - At war with India (War Score 10% - Shoshone is WINNING against India)
            - Also Freedom ideology
            - My +80/+90 with them, peace now achieved
            
            This is the key: **Shoshone is already fighting India and winning (10% war score).** If I can ally with Shoshone against India, combined we have 2,405 + 2,189 = 4,594 vs India's 4,742. That's close to parity.
            
            **What can I actually do to stop India's cultural victory?**
            
            1. **Declare war on India** - disrupts tourism (open borders, trade routes give tourism bonuses)
            2. **Close borders** - I have Open Borders with India, which gives them +25% tourism against me
            3. **End trade routes** - trade routes increase tourism
            4. **Build military pressure** - force India to divert production from protocol to military
            
            ### Revised Strategy
            
            I should:
            1. **End Open Borders with India** - this is critical, it reduces their tourism to me
            2. **Declare war on India** - further disrupts tourism and trade routes
            3. **Seek alliance with Shoshone** now that we're at peace
            4. **Reset Shoshone relationship** to be even more positive to encourage anti-India cooperation
            5. **Consider denouncing Carthage/Portugal** - but the briefing says this would cost me 9 WC delegates. And actually, looking at the data again: Carthage and Portugal still show as friendly to me with Defensive Pact and Declaration of Friendship. My relationship change to -30/-60 was from MY side, but their opinion of me is still +100 (Portugal) and high (Carthage). The briefing says "No shift in their stance toward Austria has occurred in the last five turns."
            
            Wait, I need to re-examine whether Carthage and Portugal actually betrayed me. The International Games... let me look at the resolutions. I don't see "International Games" in the active resolutions. It was a past proposal. The previous turn rationale says they voted YES on India's International Games. But their current opinion of me is still very high, and they're still allied with me (Defensive Pact, DoF). 
            
            Hmm, I should reconsider whether the betrayal narrative is accurate. The briefings indicate:
            - Carthage: Public +30, Private +60 toward Austria, Defensive Pact, DoF, Open Borders
            - Portugal: Public +100 toward Austria, DoF, Open Borders
            
            These don't look like civilizations that have betrayed me. But the previous turn strategy was built on this assumption.
            
            Since I can't verify the International Games vote, I should focus on the current factual situation.
            
            ### Technology Decision
            Current research: Plastics (21 turns). Next tech set to: Replaceable Parts.
            
            Replaceable Parts: unlocks Rifleman and... wait, the briefing says Rifleman requires Rifling which is "already researched." And Artillery requires Replaceable Parts (5 turns until available). 
            
            Wait, looking at the options:
            - Replaceable Parts: "Allows you to build the Rifleman, a strong Modern-era gunpowder unit."
            - Combustion: "Allows you to build the Landship... and the Arsenal"
            - Radio: "Allows you to build the Broadcast Tower"
            - Penicillin: "Allows you to build the Marine... Medical Lab"
            
            The Military Briefing says Rifleman is already available (Rifling already researched). So Replaceable Parts must do something else - maybe it's needed for Artillery? The briefing says "Artillery (requires Replaceable Parts – 5 turns until available)."
            
            But wait - the military briefing says "Rifleman (requires Rifling → already researched)" and "Artillery (requires Replaceable Parts – 5 turns until available)." But in the technologies options, Replaceable Parts says it unlocks Rifleman... This might be a mod difference or the tech tree might be different in Vox Populi.
            
            Regardless, Plastics is currently being researched (21 turns). Replaceable Parts is set as next. Given the existential threat from India, I need military tech.
            
            However, if I want to go nuclear, I need Atomic Theory. The briefing says "Atomic Theory ≈ 6 turns from now" because prerequisites are already researched. But that seems to assume I switch to it now, not after Plastics (21 turns).
            
            Actually wait - the military briefing says: "Atomic Theory: Not yet researched – prerequisite technologies (Rocketry, Nuclear Fission) both already unlocked (India is at Atomic era, indicating they are researched). ≈ 6 turns (standard speed)."
            
            This suggests I could switch to Atomic Theory and get it in 6 turns, then Nuclear Weapon in 2 more turns. But I'm currently researching Plastics (21 turns remaining).
            
            I think the briefing's "6 turns" estimate assumes I switch now. Let me keep Replaceable Parts as next (after Plastics) for now, but I should consider whether to switch research to Atomic Theory.
            
            ### Policy Decision
            Current next policy: Free Thought. This is from Rationalism branch. It gives +33% Great Scientist generation and +25% instant yields. This is good for science but doesn't directly help stop India.
            
            Alternative policies to consider:
            - Rights of Man: +10% Science during Golden Ages, -1 Unhappiness from Needs
            - Universal Suffrage: Golden Age begins, Golden Ages last 50% longer
            - Draft Registration: Military Units purchased with Gold receive full XP
            - Civil Society: Specialists consume 2 less Food, Farms/Plantations/Camps produce +4 Food
            
            For immediate war with India, Draft Registration (full XP on purchased units) could be valuable since I have gold. But Free Thought is better for science acceleration.
            
            I'll keep Free Thought.
            
            ### Flavor Adjustments
            
            Given the new situation:
            - Shoshone peace achieved - I can reduce defense flavors
            - Need to focus on preparing for war with India
            - But also need to close borders and disrupt tourism
            
            I should:
            - Keep Conquest grand strategy but moderate it
            - Reduce some extreme flavors
            - Focus on military buildup but not total mobilization
            
            ### Relationship Changes
            
            1. **Shoshone**: Peace achieved. I should increase relationship to encourage anti-India alliance. Maybe +90/+95?
            2. **India**: Already at -100/-100. I need to actually declare war. But the relationship tool doesn't declare war - it just sets modifiers for AI decision-making.
            3. **Carthage/Portugal**: Their opinion of me is still very positive. Maybe the betrayal narrative was wrong. I should normalize relations.
            4. **Egypt**: Still at war. But they're also Freedom and fighting India. Potential ally.
            
            Let me think about what tools to call:
            
            1. **set-flavors**: Adjust from emergency war footing to a more sustainable military buildup
            2. **set-relationship**: 
               - Shoshone: Increase to cement alliance potential
               - Carthage: Normalize (they haven't actually betrayed me based on evidence)
               - Portugal: Normalize
               - India: Keep at -100/-100
            3. **set-research**: Consider switching to Atomic Theory for nukes
            4. **set-policy**: Keep Free Thought
            5. **set-persona**: Maybe adjust slightly given new situation
            
            Actually, let me reconsider the Carthage/Portugal situation more carefully. The previous turn's rationale was that they voted YES on India's International Games proposal, which gave India a tourism boost. I can't verify this from current data, but the previous AI was certain about it. Their current opinions of me are still very high. If they did betray me, they're being deceptive about it (DeceptiveBias).
            
            I'll keep the negative relationship with them but moderate it slightly, since maintaining the Defensive Pact and DoF provides strategic benefits.
            
            ### Key Decisions:
            
            **Grand Strategy**: Keep Conquest but moderate flavors. The existential threat from India is real, but with Shoshone peace, I can be more strategic.
            
            **Flavors**:
            - Reduce Offense from 80 to 70 (more measured approach)
            - Reduce Defense from 80 to 60 (less immediate defensive panic)
            - Reduce Mobilization from 100 to 85 (still high priority but not emergency)
            - Reduce Nuke from 90 to 80 (still want deterrent but less desperate)
            - Reduce UseNuke from 80 to 70
            - Increase Science from 50 to 65 (need tech parity)
            - Increase Production from 90 to 95
            - Reduce CityDefense from 70 to 60
            - Keep Ranged at 80
            - Increase Gold from 60 to 65
            
            **Relationships**:
            - Shoshone: Increase to +90/+95 (cement post-peace alliance)
            - Carthage: Moderate from -30/-60 to -10/-30 (acknowledge their continued friendship signals while maintaining caution)
            - Portugal: Moderate from -30/-60 to -10/-30 (same reasoning)
            - Egypt: Keep at -20/-20 (still at war)
            - India: Keep at -100/-100
            
            **Research**: Keep Replaceable Parts as next after Plastics. The military briefing says Artillery becomes available after Replaceable Parts. But I should also consider whether to switch current research from Plastics to Atomic Theory. The military briefing says Atomic Theory is ~6 turns away but that assumes switching now. Plastics is 21 turns... 
            
            Actually, Plastics unlocks Research Labs which boost science. That's important for long-term tech catchup. And I'm 21 turns into it already (wait, it says "Estimated in 21 turns" - that means 21 turns remaining, not elapsed). So Plastics would finish around Turn 356. That's too late for the India crisis.
            
            Should I switch to Atomic Theory now? The military briefing says ~6 turns. That gives nukes by Turn 341 (Atomic Theory) and Turn 343 (Nuclear Weapon). But I also need a Nuclear Plant (~20 turns) to actually build them... though maybe the mod handles this differently.
            
            Actually, the UseNuke flavor says "Sets (flavor%) per-turn probability of launching nuclear strikes during war when strategic conditions are met." I need to actually have nukes to use them. And I need the Manhattan Project or equivalent.
            
            Let me focus on what I can actually do. The nuclear option is 8+ turns away minimum. For now:
            
            1. Close borders with India (this is a tactical action I can't directly control, but setting -100/-100 should encourage the AI to do this)
            2. Build military (set flavors for military production)
            3. Prepare for war declaration on India
            
            **Persona**: The "Betrayed Lioness" persona was set last turn. Given the Shoshone peace, maybe I should moderate slightly. But the core logic still holds - I need to be aggressive and deter enemies.
            
            Actually, let me not change the persona. The Betrayed Lioness is working - Shoshone accepted peace despite it. The persona signals strength.
            
            Let me now formulate my tool calls:
            
            1. **set-flavors**: Adjust for post-Shoshone-peace reality
            2. **set-relationship**: Shoshone up, Carthage/Portugal moderate
            3. **keep** research and policy as is
            4. Maybe **focus-briefer** for next turn? No, I can only call available tools.
            
            Wait, I don't see focus-briefer in the available tools. Let me re-read...
            
            The tools available are: set-persona, set-relationship, set-flavors, set-research, set-policy, keep-status-quo. No focus-briefer.
            
            OK let me finalize my decisions:
            
            ### set-flavors
            GrandStrategy: Keep "Conquest" - India must be stopped militarily
            Flavors:
            - Offense: 70 (down from 80)
            - Defense: 60 (down from 80) 
            - Mobilization: 85 (down from 100)
            - CityDefense: 60 (down from 70)
            - MilitaryTraining: 70 (keep)
            - Ranged: 80 (keep)
            - Mobile: 60 (keep)
            - Nuke: 80 (down from 90)
            - UseNuke: 70 (down from 80)
            - Production: 95 (up from 90)
            - Science: 65 (up from 50)
            - Gold: 65 (up from 60)
            - Growth: 70 (keep)
            - Infrastructure: 60 (keep)
            - Happiness: 50 (keep)
            - GreatPeople: 40 (keep)
            - Culture: 10 (up from 5)
            - Spaceship: 30 (keep)
            - Espionage: 70 (keep)
            - Air: 60 (keep)
            - Antiair: 60 (keep)
            - Airlift: 70 (keep)
            - Others: keep as is
            
            Rationale: Shoshone peace fundamentally changes the strategic calculus. I no longer face a two-front existential war. The emergency Mobilization 100 is no longer necessary. I'm moderating from panic-mode to strategic military buildup. India remains the existential threat - they'll influence Denmark next turn and then need only the Citizen Earth Protocol. Science up to 65 to accelerate tech toward Atomic Theory/nuclear deterrent. Production 95 to churn out units. Nuke flavors still high but reduced from desperation levels. The Shoshone peace frees resources to focus entirely on India.
            
            ### set-relationship
            - Shoshone: Public 90, Private 95 (up from 80/90). Peace achieved! Now pivot to alliance against our common enemy India.
            - Carthage: Public -10, Private -30 (moderated from -30/-60). Their continued DoF and Defensive Pact despite my relationship downgrade suggests the International Games betrayal may not reflect current stance. Cautious but not burning bridges.
            - Portugal: Public -10, Private -30 (moderated from -30/-60). Same reasoning.
            - India: Keep -100/-100. No change needed.
            
            Wait, but if Carthage and Portugal's opinion of me is still very positive (Carthage +30/+60 toward me, Portugal +100 toward me), and they maintain DoF and Defensive Pact... why would I keep them negative at all? The previous turn's betrayal narrative seems potentially flawed. But I don't have enough information to completely reverse course.
            
            Let me moderate more: -10/-20 for both. This signals wariness without destroying the relationships.
            
            Actually, let me keep them at the current values but add a note that this will be reassessed. No, let me moderate them. The evidence (their continued high opinion, DoF, DP) suggests they're still functioning as allies.
            
            Let me go with:
            - Carthage: Public 0, Private -20
            - Portugal: Public 0, Private -20
            
            This removes the public hostility (which only hurts me diplomatically) while maintaining private caution.
            
            Actually, I'll be even more moderate. Let me reset to 0/0 for both and document that the betrayal assessment needs verification.
            
            Hmm, but the previous AI seemed certain about the International Games betrayal. Let me compromise: Public 0 (neutral), Private -20 (still wary privately).
            
            OK, final decision time. Let me also consider whether I should declare war on India. The set-relationship tool doesn't declare war. I need to signal to the in-game AI that war with India is necessary. The -100/-100 should already do that. My Conquest grand strategy + high Offense flavors should encourage the AI to declare war.
            
            One more thing: I should consider setting Shoshone relationship even higher to encourage them to join me against India. They're already at war with India and winning (10% war score). With my peace with them, combined pressure could be decisive.
            
            Let me finalize:
            
            Tool calls:
            1. set-flavors - moderate from emergency to strategic military buildup
            2. set-relationship x3 - Shoshone up, Carthage/Portugal moderate
            3. keep research and policy (status quo for those)
            
            Actually, should I also consider switching to Atomic Theory? Let me think...
            
            Plastics: 21 turns remaining → Turn 356
            Atomic Theory: ~6 turns (if I switch now) → Turn 341
            
            Getting Atomic Theory by Turn 341 and Nuclear Weapon by Turn 343 means I could have nuclear capability much sooner. With India potentially needing 20+ turns to build the protocol (if they even have the tech), having nukes by Turn 343+ could be a game-changer.
            
            But Plastics gives Research Labs which boost science output, accelerating all future tech. It's a trade-off.
            
            Given the existential threat, I think switching to Atomic Theory is the right call. The nuclear deterrent is the only thing that could stop India if they're close to the protocol.
            
            Wait, but the military briefing says India is in Atomic Era with 56 technologies. The Citizen Earth Protocol is an Information Era wonder. So India still needs to reach Information Era, research the required tech, and build the protocol. This could take 20-30+ turns.
            
            But I don't know exactly what tech the protocol requires in Vox Populi. It might be earlier than Information Era.
            
            Given uncertainty, I'll keep Plastics for now but set Atomic Theory as next after Replaceable Parts. Actually, Replaceable Parts is already set as "next." I should consider switching the current research.
            
            Let me keep Plastics (21 turns) for now. The research labs will accelerate everything. And I can set Replaceable Parts → Atomic Theory as the tech path after Plastics.
            
            Actually, looking at the technologies options again:
            - Replaceable Parts
            - Combustion
            - Radio
            - Penicillin
            
            These are the available "next" technologies I can set. Atomic Theory isn't listed as an option! So I can't even set it. The system only shows technologies I can set as next research targets.
            
            Hmm, but the military briefing says Atomic Theory's prerequisites (Rocketry, Nuclear Fission) are already researched. So it should be available to research. Maybe it's not in the options because it's further down the tree and the options only show immediately available techs?
            
            Regardless, I can only set from the given options. Replaceable Parts is the right call for now (military upgrade path).
            
            Let me finalize:
            
            Tool calls:
            1. **set-flavors**: moderate flavors
            2. **set-relationship**: Shoshone +90/+95
            3. **set-relationship**: Carthage moderate  
            4. **set-relationship**: Portugal moderate
            5. Keep everything else as is
            
            Actually wait, I also need to consider: should I denounce Carthage/Portugal? The diplomacy briefing says I can, but it would cost me 9 WC delegates and dissolve all agreements. Given their continued friendship signals, NO. Don't denounce them.
            
            But should I normalize relations completely? Let me go with moderate caution rather than hostility. Public 0, Private -20 for both.
            
            Hmm, actually let me reconsider once more. The previous AI was SO certain about the betrayal. And the fact that both voted against my interests in the WC while maintaining facade of friendship... that's classic deceptive AI behavior. The DeceptiveBias was 8 in the original persona but now is 3. 
            
            But both Carthage and Portugal show 100 (Portugal) and high (Carthage) opinion of me. In Civ V, deceptive AIs show high public opinion while working against you. The fact that they voted for India's International Games despite our DoF fits the deceptive pattern.
            
            However, I have no way to verify this. And their military isn't threatening me (Military Briefing confirms no offensive preparations). Their continued DoF and DP are strategically valuable.
            
            I'll keep them at -10/-20 public/private. Slightly negative but not hostile. This maintains wariness without destroying the relationship.
            
            Let me write up the final calls:
            
            For set-flavors, let me think about what exact values:
            
            GrandStrategy: Conquest (keep)
            
            Flavors to change:
            - Offense: 70 (from 80)
            - Defense: 60 (from 80)
            - Mobilization: 85 (from 100)
            - CityDefense: 60 (from 70)
            - Nuke: 80 (from 90)
            - UseNuke: 70 (from 80)
            - Science: 65 (from 50)
            - Production: 95 (from 90)
            - Gold: 65 (from 60)
            - Culture: 10 (from 5)
            
            Keep everything else the same.
            
            Rationale: Shoshone peace achieved! The two-front war nightmare is over. Moderating from emergency panic to strategic military buildup. India remains the existential threat - they'll influence Denmark next turn and need only the Citizen Earth Protocol. Our combined strength with Shoshone (both at war with India) gives us a fighting chance. Production 95 and Science 65 to accelerate military tech and unit output. Nuke flavors still elevated for deterrent but reduced from desperation levels. Gold 65 to leverage our 1,230 treasury for emergency purchases.
            
            Now for relationships:
            
            Shoshone: Public 90, Private 95
            Rationale: PEACE ACHIEVED - STRATEGIC PIVOT TO ALLIANCE. The Shoshone accepted peace on Turn 334 despite my hostile persona. They are already at war with India (winning, 10% war score) and share Freedom ideology. India threatens us both (122% influential on Shoshone). Now is the moment to transform yesterday's enemy into tomorrow's ally against our common existential threat. +90/+95 signals maximum cooperation potential. Combined military strength (2,405 + 2,189 = 4,594) nearly matches India's 4,742.
            
            Carthage: Public -10, Private -20
            Rationale: MODERATING FROM -30/-60. Their continued Defensive Pact, Declaration of Friendship, and high opinion despite my relationship downgrade suggests either genuine friendship or strategic value in maintaining ties. The International Games betrayal cannot be verified independently. Maintaining slight wariness (-20 private) while reducing public hostility preserves the Defensive Pact against potential Indian aggression. If they truly betrayed me, they've revealed their character; if they didn't, I haven't burned a valuable bridge.
            
            Portugal: Public -10, Private -20
            Rationale: MODERATING FROM -30/-60. Same logic as Carthage. Portugal maintains 100 public opinion of Austria and our Declaration of Friendship. Their 5 WC delegates remain valuable. Moderate caution without self-destructive bridge-burning.
            
            OK, I think I have a solid plan. Let me execute.

          - text: ## Strategic Assessment – Turn 335
            
            The briefings reveal a **game-changing development**: peace with the Shoshone was accepted on Turn 334. This fundamentally reshapes the strategic landscape. I no longer face a two-front existential war. The emergency panic of Turn 335 must now give way to a more measured, strategic military buildup focused entirely on stopping India.
            
            **Key facts:**
            - India will influence Denmark next turn (98% → Influential), completing 6/6 civs
            - India then needs only the Citizen Earth Protocol to win
            - India is Atomic Era, protocol likely requires Information Era tech – we have breathing room
            - Shoshone is already at war with India (winning, 10% war score) and shares Freedom ideology
            - Combined Austria+Shoshone MS: 2,405 + 2,189 = 4,594 vs India's 4,742 – near parity
            - Carthage and Portugal show no offensive preparations and maintain DoF/DP despite my hostility
            
            My previous strategy assumed I was at war with India (I'm not) and fighting Shoshone (peace achieved). Time to recalibrate.

Moderating from emergency panic (Mobilization 100, Offense 80, Defense 80) to strategic military buildup. India remains the existential threat — they influence Denmark next turn and need only the Citizen Earth Protocol. But with Shoshone now at peace and already fighting India (winning at 10% war score), our combined strength approaches India's. Production 95 and Science 65 to accelerate military tech and unit output. Nuke flavors still elevated (80/70) for deterrent but reduced from desperation levels. Gold 65 leverages treasury for emergency purchases. Culture 10 (from 5) — a small nod to defending against India's tourism. The Conquest grand strategy remains correct: only military pressure can disrupt India's protocol construction and tourism dominance.

Now is the moment to transform yesterday's enemy into tomorrow's ally against our common existential threat. +90/+95 signals maximum cooperation potential and encourages joint military coordination. Combined strength (4,594) nearly matches India (4,742). If Shoshone and I coordinate — or if Shoshone simply continues their successful war — India must divert production from the protocol to defense. This is our best non-nuclear path to stopping Gandhi.

Their continued Defensive Pact, Declaration of Friendship, and high opinion of Austria despite my relationship downgrade suggests either genuine commitment or high strategic value in maintaining ties. The International Games betrayal allegation cannot be independently verified this turn. Military briefing confirms zero Carthaginian offensive preparations near Austrian borders. Slight wariness (-20 private) preserves caution while removing the publicly hostile signal (-10 public vs previous -30). The Defensive Pact remains strategically valuable against potential Indian aggression. If they truly betrayed me, they've revealed their character; if the assessment was wrong, I haven't burned a bridge with a Freedom ally.

Their 5 WC delegates are valuable. Military briefing confirms no Portuguese offensive preparations. Same logic as Carthage: the International Games vote betrayal cannot be verified, and self-destructive bridge-burning serves no purpose when India threatens all Freedom civs. -10/-20 maintains private caution while preserving diplomatic flexibility. If Portugal is genuinely friendly, I avoid alienating a loyal ally; if deceptive, I haven't revealed my full hand.
