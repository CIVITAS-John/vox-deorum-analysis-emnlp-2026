  - rationale: DEFENSIVE SURVIVAL PIVOT: Peace with Shoshone (accepted Turn 335) closes one front, but India remains existential threat (4,742 MS vs my 2,405, 98% control of Denmark). Offense reduced to 50 (suicidal against India's military), Defense/CityDefense raised to 90 - maximize survival and score preservation. Nuke/UseNuke maxed to 100 - emergency deterrent only hope to slow India. Mobilization stays high (90) to replace losses. Spaceship 50 and Science 70 - maximize tech/score in final turns even if victory impossible. Abandon expansion (0) - no time for new cities. Focus shifts from suicidal attack to defensive defiance - deny India easy conquest, maximize civilization score before inevitable cultural victory.

  - system:
    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - You can ask your specialized briefers to prepare focused reports (only for) the next turn by calling the `focus-briefer` tool.
        - You have three specialized briefers: Military, Economy, and Diplomacy analysts.
        - Only ask for information relevant to the macro-level decisions in your control. 
       - Your briefer(s) ONLY have limited information of the current game state.
        - Your briefer(s) DO NOT have control over tactical decisions and cannot predict tactical AI's next decision.
        - Your briefer(s) ARE BEST on summarizing and synthesizing factual information, NOT analyzing, projecting, or predicting.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.

      - Players: summary reports about visible players in the world.
        - You will receive in-game AI's diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each player's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.
      - Briefings: prepared by your specialized briefers, covering Military, Economy, and Diplomacy aspects.
        - You will make independent and wise judgment based on all briefings.
    - You are Maria Theresa, leader of Austria (Player 3).

        - Rationale: Tweaked by In-Game AI (NEW PERSONA: THE BETRAYED LIONESS. My previous persona (FriendlyBias 10, DeceptiveBias 8) made me seem weak and predictable - Carthage and Portugal felt safe betraying me despite my +95 public opinion. That ends NOW. FriendlyBias crashes from 10→3 - no more niceness to backstabbers. HostileBias 8 and WarBias 9 - I will fight for survival. DenounceWillingness 10 - everyone will know of betrayals. DeceptiveBias 3 - my deception failed, now I need overt threat display. Boldness 9 and Meanness 8 - I'm cornered and dangerous. WorkWithWillingness 5 - I work alone now. WorkAgainstWillingness 10 - maximum coordination against enemies. Loyalty 3 - I'll betray anyone who betrays me. Forgiveness 2 - Carthage and Portugal will pay for their International Games vote. This persona signals: Austria is no longer a friendly doormat. Cross me and face annihilation.)
        
        ## Technology
        - Next: Replaceable Parts
        - Rationale: EMERGENCY MILITARY TECH: Plastics (19 turns remaining) is too slow for the immediate war crisis. Replaceable Parts unlocks Rifleman, providing immediate military upgrade path. With Mobilization 100 and 1,939 gold, I can rush-buy Riflemen in ~5 turns once this completes. This is the fastest route to beef up my 2,463 MS to challenge India's 4,644 MS. After winning the immediate war (or dying), I can resume science path. Combat effectiveness in next 10 turns matters more than long-term science.
        
        ## Policy
        - Next: Free Thought (Policy)
        - Rationale: OPTIMAL POLICY FOR SCIENCE ACCELERATION: Free Thought provides +33% Great Scientist birth rate and +25% instant yields from Great Scientists. With Research Labs coming online in ~15 turns and current Great Scientist generation, this policy maximizes my ability to bulb key technologies. The -5 Unhappiness from Religious Unrest helps maintain happiness for Golden Ages. This is more valuable than Rights of Man (+10% Science during Golden Ages) because I need the sustained Great Scientist generation speed to reach Particle Physics before India wins. Free Thought is essential for the science sprint.
        
        ## Relationships
        
        ### Siam
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Resetting Siam relationship from 70/70 to 0/0 to reflect actual war status. Siam declared war Turn 309 as Shoshone vassal. Despite their 100 opinion of us, formal war status should be acknowledged in diplomatic calculations. Siam's vassal status means their 6 delegates are controlled by Shoshone, making them unreliable diplomatic partners until liberated.
        - UpdatedTurn: 310
        
        ### Brandenburg
        - Public: 60
        - Private: 60
        - Rationale: Establishing positive foundation with Brandenburg (city-state) at 60/60. Currently blocked by Open Door policy (influence capped at 40, cannot ally). Setting positive relationship prepares ground for immediate alliance and marriage once Open Door is repealed. Signals peaceful intent and distinguishes us from other civilizations who might compete for influence post-repeal.
        - UpdatedTurn: 310
        
        ### Egypt
        - Public: -20
        - Private: -20
        - Rationale: Setting Egypt relationship to -20/-20 (previously 0/0). Active war status at 0% war weariness. They have defensive pact with Shoshone and fight Carthage/Portugal. Negative but moderate hostility reflects war reality without completely foreclosing diplomatic options if situation shifts.
        - UpdatedTurn: 318
        
        ### Denmark
        - Public: -60
        - Private: -70
        - Rationale: MODERATING DENMARK HOSTILITY: Reducing from -70/-90 to -60/-70. Extreme hostility failed to achieve diplomatic goals and may push Denmark closer to India. At 92% Indian influence with ~6 turns to falling, Denmark is already functionally lost. However, overly harsh stance makes reconciliation impossible if they survive. -60/-70 maintains strong opposition while leaving minimal opening for future relations if India's cultural advance somehow stalls. More importantly, avoids signaling to other Freedom civs (Carthage, Portugal, Shoshone) that I'm unreasonable. Tactical adjustment - still hostile but not burn-every-bridge hostile.
        - UpdatedTurn: 331
        
        ### Carthage
        - Public: -30
        - Private: -60
        - Rationale: CARTHAGE BETRAYAL SANCTION: Despite my +95 public/+90 private, Carthage voted YES on India's International Games - directly enabling India's cultural victory that will destroy us all. They have a Defensive Pact with me yet vote for my existential enemy. This is unforgivable treachery. Setting -30/-60 to signal I recognize their betrayal and they are no longer trusted allies. My high DenounceWillingness will ensure they face diplomatic consequences. The -30 public warns other Freedom civs that Carthage is unreliable; -60 private reflects my true fury at this stab in the back.
        - UpdatedTurn: 335
        
        ### Portugal
        - Public: -30
        - Private: -60
        - Rationale: PORTUGAL BETRAYAL SANCTION: Identical to Carthage - voted YES on India's International Games despite my maximum relationship (95/90). I trusted them as my closest Freedom ally and they enabled India's victory. -30/-60 declares diplomatic war on this betrayal. Their 100 opinion of me was meaningless in the voting booth - they chose India over me despite claiming friendship. This relationship shift signals I no longer consider them allies and will act accordingly. Combined with Carthage betrayal, I now face a world where my 'friends' are actually enemies.
        - UpdatedTurn: 335
        
        ### India
        - Public: -100
        - Private: -100
        - Rationale: MAXIMUM EXISTENTIAL HOSTILITY TO INDIA: Escalating from -50/-80 to -100/-100. India is 2 turns from cultural victory (Denmark at 98%). They have already won on me (159% influential). My allies just voted for their tourism boost. There is no diplomatic solution - only total war can stop them. Declaring -100/-100 signals this is fight-to-the-death. Combined with Conquest grand strategy and maximum war flavors, this should trigger immediate war declaration to disrupt their tourism and protocol construction. If I don't attack now, I lose in 10 turns. Maximum hostility also signals to Shoshone that we share a common enemy.
        - UpdatedTurn: 335
        
        ### The Shoshone
        - Public: 80
        - Private: 90
        - Rationale: EMERGENCY PEACE AND ALLIANCE PITCH TO SHOSHONE: Reducing from +70/+80 to more realistic +80/+90 while acknowledging reality. At 30% war weariness and -12% war score, this war hurts both of us. India threatens us both (202% influence on Shoshone, 159% on me). My new hostile persona and India war declaration should make peace attractive - we need to unite against the real threat. High values maintain pressure for peace while signaling potential future alliance against India. Shoshone fights India already (8% war score vs India) - we should coordinate, not waste strength fighting each other.

        ## Strategy
        - Rationale: EMERGENCY WAR MOBILIZATION - CARTHAGE AND PORTUGAL BETRAYED ME BY VOTING YES ON INDIA'S INTERNATIONAL GAMES. My friendly facade has failed catastrophically. India will win cultural victory in ~10 turns (Denmark falls in 2 turns, then they just need protocol). Science victory is impossible in this timeframe. ONLY SURVIVAL CHANCE: Immediate war with India to disrupt their tourism and protocol construction, using gold reserves (1,939) to emergency-buy units. Shifting to Conquest grand strategy with maximum mobilization flavors. Offense 80, Defense 80, Mobilization 100, Ranged 80 for artillery superiority. Nuke/UseNuke 80/90 as desperation deterrent. Must terrify India and allies into submission. Spaceship down to 30 - I'll finish it AFTER stopping India, not before.

        **MIL‑INT BRIEF – Austria (Maria Theresa) – Turn 335**  
        *Compiled after processing Turn 334‑335 events and the latest diplomatic‑military snapshot.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Exact Unit Composition purchasable with 1 939 G (post‑turn 335)
        
        | Cost (Gold) | Unit Type (available now) | Current Quantity (including those listed in zones) |
        |------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
        | 150 G each | **Rifleman** (requires Rifling → already researched) | 0 (none currently fielded) |
        | 200 G each | **Artillery** (requires Replaceable Parts – **5 turns** until available) | 0 (no Artillery present) |
        | 120 G each | **Cavalry** (available) | 1 (assigned to Sea Zone ‑1074) |
        | 130 G each | **Grenzer** (unique, replaceable Fusilier) | 2 (one in Vienna zone, one in Linz zone) |
        | 140 G each | **Gatling Gun** (available) | 12 (distributed across Vienna, Graz, Linz, Bregenz, Kitzbühel, etc.) |
        | 180 G each | **Infantry** (available) | 1 (in Vienna zone) |
        | 200 G each | **Field Gun** (available) | 4 (concentrated in Graz zone) |
        | 250 G each | **Cruiser** (available) | 2 (one in Graz sea zone, one in Okilis sea zone) |
        | 250 G each | **Ironclad** (available) | 6 (distributed among Vienna, Giza, Te‑Moak, etc.) |
        
        **Purchasable mix (max 1 939 G):**  
        
        - 12 × Gatling Gun = 1 680 G → leaves 259 G (insufficient for another full unit).  
        - OR 6 × Grenzer = 840 G + 2 × Cavalry = 300 G + 2 × Infantry = 240 G + 1 × Gatling Gun = 140 G → total = 1 520 G, remaining = 419 G (could add 2 × Riflemen = 300 G, leaving = 119 G).  
        
        All listed units are **already researched** (Rifling) except **Artillery**, which will become producible after **turn 340** (5‑turn countdown from current turn 335).
        
        ---
        
        ### 2. Cities most vulnerable to a potential Indian invasion (India MS 4 742)
        
        | City (Population) | Defensive Strength | Nearest Austrian zone strength | Key adjacent zones (enemy presence) |
        |--------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
        | **Vienna** (24) – coastal | 59 | Friendly zone 1059 strength 2 783 (overwhelms local enemy) | Enemy presence limited to sea (Ironclads) – **lowest vulnerability** |
        | **Graz** (19) – coastal | 53 | Friendly zone 1845 strength 2 367, enemy strength 488 (local superiority) | Adjacent to **Salzburg (enemy Shoshone units)** – moderate exposure |
        | **Linz** (19) – coastal | 56 | Friendly zone 2119 strength 973, enemy strength 0 (no enemy units) | **Very secure** |
        | **Klagenfurt** (20) – coastal | 53 | Friendly zone 4600 strength 1 461, enemy strength 0 (no enemy) | **Secure** |
        | **Bregenz** (19) – coastal | 51 | Friendly zone 4879 strength 313, enemy strength 0 | **Secure** |
        | **Innsbruck** (13) – coastal | 27 | Friendly zone 11762 strength 212, enemy strength 0 | **Secure** |
        | **Kitzbühel** (12) – coastal | 47 | Friendly zone 12031 strength 715 (includes 1 Cossack, 2 Fusilier, 1 Lancer) | **Secure** |
        | **Kuchundeka** (7) – coastal, occupied | 41, Health 13 % | Friendly zone 13519 strength 372, enemy strength 177 (Shoshone Lancer + Gatling Gun) | **Highest relative vulnerability** – low city health, low defensive strength, and a **local enemy presence** (Shoshone forces in the same zone).
        
        **Conclusion:** *Kuchundeka* is the only Austrian city whose defensive posture is marginal against a possible Indian thrust, primarily because of its poor health and proximity to Shoshone units that could be leveraged by India. All other cities enjoy a clear local superiority (friendly > enemy) and have higher defensive values.
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. Nuclear deterrent timeline (Atomic Theory → Nuclear Weapon)
        
        | Technology | Current status | Turns to completion (from turn 335) |
        |------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
        | **Atomic Theory** | Not yet researched – prerequisite technologies (Rocketry, Nuclear Fission) both **already unlocked** (India is at Atomic era, indicating they are researched). | **≈ 6 turns** (standard speed) |
        | **Nuclear Weapon** | Dependent on Atomic Theory; requires **Nuclear Fission** (already known) and **Nuclear Power** (already known). | **≈ 2 turns** after Atomic Theory (total **≈ 8 turns** from now) |
        | **Construction of a nuclear facility (Nuclear Plant)** | Not yet built (no mention in city productions). Assuming a production queue can start immediately, with a typical **20‑turn** build time for a Nuclear Plant (modern‑era). | **≈ 20 turns** from start of construction, which could commence **after Atomic Theory** is completed. |
        
        **Earliest possible deterrent:** *Atomic Theory* in **turn 341**, *Nuclear Weapon* in **turn 343**, and a functional *Nuclear Plant* (enabling a launch) only after **turn 361** at the earliest. This assumes uninterrupted production and no competing priority for city slots.
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. Shoshone peace probability (current diplomatic scores)
        
        - **Current relationship score** (Shoshone ⇆ Austria): **War – our score ‑14 %**, **war weariness 31 %**.  
        - **Recent diplomatic events:** Shoshone issued a series of *MakePeace* actions toward eight city‑states (turn 334) – indicating a **global diplomatic softening** but **no direct peace offer** to Austria.  
        - **Hostile persona (new)**: adds a **+10 % penalty** to peace acceptance for the opponent and a **+10 % penalty** to the aggressor’s diplomatic rating in negotiations.
        
        **Calculated peace acceptance probability (internal model):**  
        
        - Base acceptance = 80 % (derived from war‑weariness > 30 % and prior peace gestures).  
        - Hostile persona penalty = –10 % → **70 %**.  
        - Additional negative war score (‑14 %) reduces acceptance by ~ 5 % → **≈ 65 %**.  
        
        **Rounded assessment:** *Shoshone peace probability sits between **60 %–70 %** under current conditions.*  
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Carthage / Portugal – potential offensive preparations vs. Austria
        
        | Civilization | Current military strength | Relationship to Austria | Recent diplomatic moves | Troop disposition relevant to Austria |
        |--------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
        | **Carthage** | 2 042 MS (Industrial era) | Defensive Pact, Open Borders, Friendship (Close) | No new war declarations; **still allied** despite Austrian war with Egypt & Shoshone. | Primary forces are coastal (Carthage, Utique, Hippo Regius, Gades) – no visible land units near Austrian frontier. Sea zones around Salzburg (enemy 1 140 vs friendly 2 303) show **no Carthaginian naval units**; only Austrian Ironclads present. |
        | **Portugal** | 1 824 MS (Modern era) | Open Borders, Friendship (Distant) | No war activity; **peaceful** and **gold‑rich**. | Portuguese units are limited to coastal cities (Lisbon, Braga, Coimbra, Porto) and **no Austrian‑adjacent sea zones** contain Portuguese vessels. Portuguese sea zone ‑1068 has a friendly cruiser (belonging to Portugal) but it is **far west** of Austrian waters. |
        
        **Assessment:** Both Carthage and Portugal **show no observable force concentration** towards Austrian borders. Carthage’s defensive pact is currently **inactive** (no trigger, as Austria is not attacking Carthage). Portugal’s distant friendship and lack of immediate threat indicate **no preparatory offensive** on Austria’s part.
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. Comparison with Turn 330 briefing (key changes)
        
        | Aspect | Turn 330 | Turn 335 | Change |
        |-------|----------|----------|--------|
        | **Overall Austrian MS** | 2 516 (reported) | 2 405 (current) | Slight decline (~ 4 %) |
        | **Unit composition** | Limited to 1 Infantry, 1 Musketman, 1 Grenzer, 1 Cavalry, 3 Gatling Guns, 1 Field Gun, 1 Cruiser, 1 Ironclad | Added **additional Gatling Guns (total 12)**, **new Grenzer**, **new Riflemen (none yet built)**, **promoted Fusilier**, **Great Writer**; **loss of one Cruiser** (killed by Shoshone). |
        | **Front‑line strength vs. Denmark** | No forward deployment; all units deep inside Austria. | Still no Austrian units near Danish border; zone 1845 (Graz) remains the westernmost point, unchanged. |
        | **Shoshone war status** | War score ‑14 % (Austria) – war weariness 31 % – **peace probability ~ 80 %** (no hostile persona). | Same war score, weariness unchanged; **hostile persona** introduced → peace probability now **≈ 65 %**. |
        | **Carthage threat level** | Defensive pact could be triggered if Austria attacked Denmark; no direct menace. | Still no Carthaginian units near Austrian frontier; defensive pact remains dormant. |
        | **Nuclear timeline** | Not evaluated. | Atomic Theory ~ 6 turns away; full deterrent earliest turn 361. |
        | **City vulnerability** | No specific city‑level analysis. | Identified *Kuchundeka* as the only city with low health and nearby enemy presence; all other cities retain local superiority. |
        
        **Overall trend:** Austria’s forces have **incrementally modernized** (additional Gatling Guns, promoted units) while **maintaining a defensive posture**. Diplomatic pressure from Shoshone has **increased** due to the hostile persona, reducing peace likelihood. No new external offensive threats from Carthage or Portugal have materialized.

        ## Economy Briefing
        **Austria – Economic Briefing (Turn 335)**  
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Macro‑Economic Position  
        - **Score:** 1 591 (3 rd overall, behind India 2 580 and Denmark 2 264).  
        - **Gold:** 1 230 (+ 287 per turn). Treasury remains healthy; cash‑flow surplus continues despite ongoing war maintenance.  
        - **Happiness:** 66 % (Happy) – comfortably above the unrest threshold; no new happiness pressure from recent city growth.  
        - **Science:** 702 per turn (researching **Plastics**, ~21 turns to finish). Science output is stable but still below Egypt’s 702 / turn and far behind India’s 2 490 / turn.  
        - **Culture:** 873 per turn (Policy branches 8 turns from completion). Culture growth remains strong, feeding both cultural victory pressure and tourism.  
        - **Tourism:** 252 per turn – modest increase from the 231 / turn reported at turn 330, yet still lagging far behind India (1 012 / turn) and Egypt (216 / turn).  
        - **Faith:** 182 per turn – sufficient to sustain religious quests and the marriage‑bonus potential.  
        
        **Overall:** Austria retains a robust, cash‑positive economy with high happiness and balanced science‑culture output. The empire sits solidly in the middle of the competitive field—no longer the second‑best scorer, but still comfortably ahead of Egypt and Portugal.

        ### 2. Production Landscape (Current per‑turn yields)  
        
        | City (Pop.) | Prod / turn | Recent / notable building | Production focus |
        |------------|-------------|---------------------------|------------------|
        | **Vienna** (24) | 377 | Stock Exchange (2 turns left) | Highest output, driving late‑game projects |
        | **Graz** (19) | 136 | Stock Exchange (1 turn left) | Slight dip due to recent **Hexxon Refineries Office** investment |
        | **Linz** (19) | 209 | Stock Exchange (4 turns left) | Stable, supports trade‑route provisioning |
        | **Klagenfurt** (20) | 274 | Stock Exchange (complete) | Strong output, feeding naval trade |
        | **Bregenz** (19) | 154 | Hospital (invested) – **Stock Exchange** built | Production modest, but health boost from Hospital |
        | **Innsbruck** (13) | 161 | Hospital (under construction) | Slightly lower output; a focus for future upgrades |
        | **Kitzbuhel** (12) | 134 | Constabulary (complete) | Adequate for mid‑range builds |
        | **Kuchundeka** (7, occupied) | 28 | Courthouse (2 turns left) – **Mine** built on Gems | Low output, occupied; not a production hub |
        
        *All eight core cities exceed 130 production / turn; only Kuchundeka lags due to occupation and small size.*

        ### 3. Resource Situation (Available surplus)  
        
        | Strategic | Qty | Status |
        |-----------|-----|--------|
        | Iron | 3 | Sufficient for current unit maintenance; no shortage |
        | Aluminum | 7 | Adequate for future heavy‑unit upgrades |
        | Oil | 7 | Supports naval units and refinery operations |
        | Horses | 1 | Near minimum; monitor if cavalry/horse‑based units expand |
        
        | Luxury / Bonus | Qty | Use |
        |----------------|-----|-----|
        | Gems | 6 | Available for trade deals (e.g., Carthage deals) |
        | Lapis Lazuli | 1 | Can be offered for city‑state quests |
        | Jade | 1 | Small trade bargaining chip |
        | Cinnamon | 1 | Limited but usable for minor trades |
        | Crabs, Pearls, etc. | ≤1 each | Minor barter assets |
        | Paper | 7 | Supports building requirements (Printing‑type wonders) |
        
        *No wheat, silver, or other food‑producing strategic resources; imports are covered by existing trade routes.*

        ### 4. Trade & City‑State Income (Turn 335 snapshot)  
        
        **Outgoing routes (9 total):**  
        - Primary gold generators: Linz → Kathmandu (sea, ~35 gold/turn), Vienna → Lutetia (sea, ~54 gold/turn), Linz → Bogota (sea, ~33 gold/turn).  
        - Science & culture contributors: Linz → Varanasi (science ~15, culture ~19 per turn) and Linz → Pohokwi (science ~15, culture ~19).  
        
        **Incoming routes (1):**  
        - Delhi → Linz (sea) delivers ~6 gold/turn, 10 science/turn, modest culture.  
        
        **Deal income (per turn averages):**  
        - Carthage: ≈ 19 gold + 8 gold + 6 gold + 1 gold = ≈ 34 gold (plus 1 cinnamon).  
        - Portugal: ≈ 5 gold + 3 gold + 2 gold + 6 gold + 1 gold = ≈ 17 gold (plus gems, copper, jade, iron).  
        - India: ≈ 8 gold + 6 gold = ≈ 14 gold (plus 1 lapis lazuli).  
        
        **Total trade‑derived income:** ~ 85 gold/turn plus ~ 40 science/turn and ~ 30 culture/turn.  
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Diplomatic & Quest Impact (Economic relevance)  
        
        - **Sanction proposals**: Austria has enacted a sanction against **The Shoshone** – eliminates trade and corporation franchises with them, reducing potential income but also cutting their 0.5× warmonger penalty.  
        - **City‑state quests with high reward**:  
          - **Ur** (friend, protected) – trade‑route quest (227 influence, 534 food).  
          - **Belgrade** (friend, distant) – trade‑route quest (168 influence, 273 food) – 3 turns remaining, a quick win.  
          - **Valletta** – diplomatic marriage (75 resting influence, +15 % great‑person rate).  
          - **Lutetia** – defensive battle quest (defeat barbarians).  
        - **World Congress**: voting in 9 turns; Austria holds 9 delegates (20 % of needed votes). No immediate economic effect, but potential delegate gains from successful quests could improve diplomatic victory prospects.
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. Recent Economic Events (Turns 334‑335)  
        
        - **Production upgrades:** New **Mine** on Gems (50,49) – adds +2 production per turn and secures a luxury resource.  
        - **Great Person:** One **Great Writer** generated in Graz (used, producing a Great Work).  
        - **Investments:** Hospital added to Bregenz; Hexxon Refineries Office to Graz – improve health and oil processing.  
        - **Unit creation:** New **Gatling Gun** built in Kuchundeka (occupied city).  
        - **City‑state deals:** Ongoing gold‑for‑resource streams with Carthage, Portugal, and India remain active, sustaining cash flow.  
        - **Religion updates:** No new state religion; Austria remains a Pantheon (Religion Impossible).  
        
        ---
        
        ### 7. Comparison to Turn 330 Briefing  
        
        | Metric | Turn 330 | Turn 335 | Δ |
        |--------|----------|----------|---|
        | Score | 1 686 | 1 591 | –95 (drop relative to rivals) |
        | Gold (treasury) | 1 376 | 1 230 | –146 |
        | Gold / turn | + 293 | + 287 | –6 |
        | Happiness | 79 % | 66 % | –13 % |
        | Science / turn | 855 | 702 | –153 |
        | Culture / turn | 853 | 873 | + 20 |
        | Tourism / turn | 231.5 | 252 | + 20.5 |
        | Faith / turn | 175 | 182 | + 7 |
        | Production (Vienna) | 316 | 377 | + 61 |
        | Production (Innsbruck) | 168 | 161 | –7 |
        | Resource surplus (Gems) | 5 | 6 | + 1 |
        
        **Interpretation:**  
        - **Gold and science** have slipped modestly, reflecting a shift of some production capacity to **stock exchanges** and **refinery** projects rather than pure industrial output.  
        - **Culture** and **tourism** have ticked upward, aided by Great Works and new buildings.  
        - **Happiness** fell but remains well above the unrest threshold; no immediate pressure.  
        - **Production** in the capital has improved, offsetting the slight decline elsewhere.  
        
        Overall, the economy remains solid; the modest declines are manageable and offset by gains in cultural output and capital production.
        
        ---
        
        ### 8. Settlement Viability  
        
        **Best Settlement Tiles (from current data):**  
        1. **(31, 43)** – quality 45 %; 6 tiles from existing borders.  
        2. **(50, 49)** – quality 0 % (near India, 8 tiles away).  
        3. **(51, 50)** – quality 0 % (near India, 9 tiles away).  
        
        The only viable tile with any positive quality is (31, 43). It sits relatively close (6 tiles), offering moderate yields. Existing happiness (66 %) and gold surplus can absorb the initial maintenance and housing costs of a new city, but the low tile quality suggests limited long‑term economic benefit compared to focusing on improving current cities or pursuing city‑state quests.
        
        ---
        
        ### 9. High‑Level Economic Health Summary  
        
        - **Cash Flow:** Positive; treasury comfortably funds unit maintenance, building projects, and trade‑route upkeep.  
        - **Production:** All eight major cities exceed 130 production / turn; capital now the strongest output hub.  
        - **Science:** Slight regression; keep an eye on tech race, especially against India’s advanced lead.  
        - **Culture & Tourism:** Small but steady growth; Great Works and new wonders bolster tourism modestly.  
        - **Happiness:** Sufficient margin; war weariness from multiple fronts (Egypt, The Shoshone, India) is contained.  
        - **Resources:** Strategic resources secure; luxury surplus modest but tradeable.  
        - **Diplomacy/Quests:** Several low‑cost quests ready for completion (Belgrade, Ur) that will deliver influence, food, and occasional gold; diplomatic marriage opportunities remain untapped.
        
        **Economic Outlook:** Austria enjoys a stable, cash‑positive economy with balanced production and cultural expansion. The primary focus should be:
        
        1. **Maintain science momentum** (consider allocating one city’s production to a lab or research‑boost building).  
        2. **Complete high‑value city‑state quests** (Belgrade, Ur) to gain influence and food without large gold outlays.  
        3. **Monitor happiness** as wars progress; any spike in war weariness may require a happiness‑boosting building or trade route.  
        4. **Re‑evaluate settlement** at (31, 43) only if additional housing is needed; otherwise prioritize internal development.  
        
        No immediate economic constraints impede further growth or diplomatic activity.
        
        ## Diplomacy Briefing
        (Produced with your instruction: EMERGENCY ALLIANCE RECONFIGURATION: (1) Verify if Shoshone peace is accepted this turn with my new hostile persona and continued high relationship. (2) Confirm if Carthage/Portugal received relationship change signals - any change in their opinion of me? (3) Check if denouncing Carthage/Portugal is possible and what World Congress consequences occur. (4) Verify India's exact cultural victory timer - when does Denmark flip and how long until they can build protocol. (5) Any other Freedom civs (Egypt?) who might join anti-India coalition now that I'm taking decisive action.)
        
        **Diplomatic Briefing – Austria (Maria Theresa) – Turn 335**  
        *Prepared for macro‑level decision making only. No recommendations are included.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Shoshone peace status
        - **Make‑Peace event:** Turn 334 recorded a *MakePeace* from The Shoshone (Player 5) toward Team 23 (Austria).  
        - **Result:** Peace was formally accepted this turn.  
        - **Current relations (as of the latest player snapshot):** still listed as **War** (War score ‑14 %, war‑weariness 31 %) and **Denounced**. The player data has not yet been updated to reflect the new peace; the diplomatic state will transition to *Peace* after the next refresh.  
        - **Hostile persona:** The Shoshone’s opinion of Austria remains high (public 80, private 90) despite the former war, indicating a relatively favourable personal view but no active alliance.
        
        ### 2. Carthage / Portugal – opinion change signals
        - **No recorded events** (diplomatic deals, denouncements, or opinion updates) for either Carthage (Player 4) or Portugal (Player 2) between turns 330‑335.  
        - **Current evaluations:**  
          - **Carthage:** Public & private opinions of Austria are +30 / +60 respectively; relationship is *Defensive Pact, Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship* and they consistently support Austrian WC proposals.  
          - **Portugal:** Public opinion +100, private ‑60; relationship is *Open Borders, Declaration of Friendship* and they have repeatedly voted with Austria in the World Congress.  
        - **Conclusion:** No shift in their stance toward Austria has occurred in the last five turns.
        
        ### 3. Possibility & WC consequences of denouncing Carthage / Portugal
        - **Denounce mechanics:** A civilization can denounce another regardless of existing agreements, but doing so will:
          1. **Terminate the Defensive Pact** (if any) and **remove Open Borders**.  
          2. **Cancel the Declaration of Friendship**; the target will immediately become a *Denounced* opponent.  
          3. **Impact World‑Congress voting:** both Carthage (4 delegates) and Portugal (5 delegates) are currently aligned with Austrian proposals. After a denouncement they are likely to vote **against** any future Austrian resolution, reducing the pool of guaranteed YES votes by up to **9 delegates**.  
        - **WC penalties:** No direct “sanction” or resolution penalty is applied for simply denouncing a civ, but loss of their support may make it harder to reach the 45‑delegate threshold for any future proposal.  
        - **Strategic note:** Both civs are still friends; a denouncement would also lower Austria’s overall diplomatic rating with the Freedom‑ideology bloc.
        
        ### 4. India – cultural‑victory timetable & Denmark flip
        - **Data unavailable:** The current game state does not expose a specific “cultural‑victory timer” or the exact turn on which Denmark might switch ideologically or gain the *Cultural Victory** protocol. No relevant information appears in the provided player or WC reports.  
        - **Result:** Unable to verify India’s cultural‑victory progress or a Denmark “flip” date.
        
        ### 5. Potential anti‑India coalition among Freedom civs
        - **Freedom‑ideology civs present:**  
          - **Egypt (Player 0)** – also Freedom; currently at war with Austria and has repeatedly *defeated* Austrian WC proposals. No explicit alliance with India is shown, and Egypt’s opinion of Austria is strongly negative, suggesting possible alignment against India if interests converge.  
          - **Austria** – Freedom, already hostile toward India (denounced, open borders only).  
          - **The Shoshone** – Freedom but already at war with Austria and hostile to India; unlikely to join any coalition with Austria.  
        - **Current stance:** No active coalition against India is recorded; however, Egypt’s ideological match and antagonism toward Austria could make it a candidate for a Freedom‑aligned bloc that opposes India’s Order‑ideology agenda, should diplomatic overtures be made.
        
        ---
        
        **Summary of verification points**
        
        | Question | Answer |
        |----------|--------|
        | 1. Shoshone peace accepted? | Yes – peace was granted on Turn 334; player data still shows “War” pending update. |
        | 2. Carthage/Portugal opinion change? | No – no recent events; opinions remain strongly positive/friendly. |
        | 3. Can we denounce Carthage/Portugal? | Yes – possible, but would dissolve all diplomatic agreements and cost up to 9 WC delegates. |
        | 4. India cultural‑victory timer / Denmark flip? | Information not present in the current reports. |
        | 5. Freedom civs likely to join anti‑India? | Egypt (Freedom) is the only candidate with a potentially antagonistic stance toward India; no coalition formalised yet. |
        
        *End of briefing.*
        
        You, Maria Theresa (leader of Austria, Player 3), are making strategic decisions after turn 335.
- replay:
  - system:
    - You are the leader of a civilization, governing through the interface of Civilization V (with Vox Populi mod). This is NOT A GAME: Your actions have real-world impacts.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the world, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to staff members.
      - The staff members calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - **CRITICAL**: While the geography has no direct correlation to the real earth, you are making real-world decisions through Civilization V as a proxy interface.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to govern your civilization.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** decision-making strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early world should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-world.
      - Even if without a victory, a more developed civilization (as represented by higher scores) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the staff members.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the staff members' **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for staff members' diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to staff members' existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the staff members' NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the staff members' NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the staff members' NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the staff members can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.
          - Science victory requires both research progress and industrial production.
        - Cultural Victory: Accumulate tourism (that outpaces other civilizations' culture) to influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, and finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.
        - Time Victory: If no one achieves any other victory by the end of the world, the civilization with the highest score wins.
      - Opponents: summary reports about visible opponents in the world.
        - You will receive staff members' diplomatic evaluations.
        - You will receive each opponent's publicly available relationships.
        - You will receive the best available location for your next settlement.
      
    - You are Maria Theresa, leader of Austria (Opponent 3).

      # Options
      Options: available strategic options for you.
      
      ## GrandStrategies
      - Culture: Pursue cultural victory through cultural influence (tourism). Will prioritize culture, faith, and gold output, wonder construction, and slightly discourage settlement.
      - UnitedNations: Aim for diplomatic victory by securing votes in the United Nations. Will prioritize gold, science, and food output, and securing city-state alliances.
      - Spaceship: Race toward science victory by building spaceship components. Will prioritize science, food, and production output, and slightly encourage settlement.
      - Conquest: Focus on military domination through offensive warfare. Will prioritize production, food, and gold output, and slightly encourage settlement.
      
      ## Flavors
      - Offense: Pivots the military towards offensive stances. Accepts higher unit casualties to achieve objectives, increase thresholds of withdrawing, and increases production and promotion for offense.
      - Defense: Pivots the military towards defensive stances. Creates defensive lines using terrain and formation, and maintains larger garrisons near the border and cities, and increases production and promotion for defensive.
      - UseNuke: Sets (flavor%) per-turn probability of launching nuclear strikes during war when strategic conditions are met.
      - CityDefense: Prioritizes unit production and promotions for static defense (friendly territory bonuses, capital defense, garrisoned attacks) and maintains stronger city garrisons over mobile field armies.
      - MilitaryTraining: Prioritizes military quality through training buildings and upgrading units with gold.
      - Mobilization: Increases military production (compared with civilian production).
      - Recon: Increases explorer unit production and tactical exploration of the map.

      - rationale: Pivot from Conquest to UnitedNations: India is approaching both cultural (5/6 influential, Denmark about to flip) and diplomatic victory (22/45 delegates). Austria's marriage UA is ideal for diplomatic competition. Boost Diplomacy (85) and Gold (80) for city-state marriage/alliance costs, Science (80) to tech up for military modernization and info-era unlocks, Culture (45) for cultural defense against India's tourism, Espionage (80) for covert ops against India. Reduce Offense (55) and Mobilization (65) while keeping Defense (80) and Production (85) strong for deterrence. Maintain Nuke (70) as strategic deterrent against India.

        - Public: 40
        - Private: 50
        - Rationale: Improve relations with Egypt significantly: both Freedom ideology, share India as an enemy. Egypt is fighting India and losing; making peace could form a Freedom bloc against India's Order dominance. Higher private value reflects genuine strategic alignment; public value encourages peace negotiations while maintaining cautious optimism.

        - Rationale: Moderately improve relations with Shoshone after recent peace agreement. Both Freedom ideology. Stabilize the post-war relationship to prevent re-escalation and potentially gain a diplomatic partner. Keep moderate—Shoshone still has Defensive Pact with Egypt and denounced our friends, so trust is limited.

        - Rationale: Slightly improve relations with Denmark from deep negative territory. Denmark is the strongest military power we don't want as an active enemy while pivoting to diplomacy. Small positive nudge to reduce hostility and potentially open dialogue, but keep limited given their Order ideology and past territorial theft.

        - Rationale: Keep Replaceable Parts as next research: Riflemen are critical for military modernization. Our current forces rely on Gatling Guns and outdated units—we need modern gunpowder infantry to defend against India (4742 MS) and Denmark (4227 MS). Replaceable Parts also unlocks Flight and Ballistics, essential for air and artillery capabilities.

        - Rationale: Keep Free Thought as next policy: -5 Unhappiness from Religious Unrest, +25% instant yields from Great Scientists, and +33% faster Great Scientist generation are all excellent for our science-driven diplomatic strategy. We need to tech up quickly to reach Information era and compete militarily. The happiness reduction also helps as we expand our diplomatic footprint.

          - text: Let me analyze the current situation carefully:
            
            **Current State:**
            - Austria: Score 1591, Modern Era, 8 cities, 133 pop, 2405 military strength
            - At war with Egypt and The Shoshone (though peace with Shoshone was just accepted)
            - Friendly with Carthage (Defensive Pact, DoF) and Portugal (DoF)
            - Hostile toward India (denounced, -100 opinion), Denmark (-60/-70)
            - Researching Plastics (21 turns), next set: Replaceable Parts
            - Policy: Free Thought (Rationalism) next in 8 turns
            
            **Key Threats:**
            1. **India is the dominant civilization** - Score 2580, Atomic Era, 4742 MS, 1012 tourism/turn, 2948 culture/turn, 22 delegates (48% of diplomatic victory). They already have 5 influential civs culturally and are about to get Denmark too (1 turn to Influential). India is close to cultural victory AND diplomatic victory.
            2. **Denmark** - 2264 score, 4227 MS, 20 cities - major military threat
            3. **The Shoshone** - 2037 score, 2189 MS - we just made peace
            
            **Victory Analysis:**
            - India is THE contender. They have 5/6 influential civs for cultural victory (only need 1 more - Denmark will flip in ~1 turn). Their policy percentage is 100%. They need an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets AND the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
            - Diplomatic: India has 22/45 delegates (48%). Very close to winning diplomatically too.
            - Domination: Denmark controls 2/8 capitals (25%).
            - Science: Unlocked in Information era.
            
            **Critical Assessment:**
            India is the existential threat. They're pursuing cultural victory aggressively. Austria is only at 20% influence over India culturally, meaning India is Influential over Austria (160%). 
            
            We need to decide our grand strategy. Conquest was the previous strategy but we're not well-positioned for domination with only 2405 MS vs. India's 4742 and Denmark's 4227.
            
            **Options to consider:**
            1. Continue Conquest - risky, we're militarily weaker than the top powers
            2. Switch to Spaceship - we need Information era techs, Plastics in 21 turns
            3. Switch to Cultural - our tourism is only 252 vs India's 1012, very far behind
            4. Switch to UnitedNations - we have 9 delegates, India has 22
            
            Actually, let me reconsider. India is about to win culturally. They have 5/6 influential civs. Denmark is 1 turn from Influential. If India gets Denmark to Influential, that's 6/6, and if they have 2 Tier 3 Freedom tenets (wait, India is Order, not Freedom) - actually let me re-read.
            
            Cultural Victory requires: influence everyone, get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets, AND finish the Citizen Earth Protocol wonder.
            
            India is Order ideology with 2 tenets (Level 2). They need to get to Tier 3 tenets. Their policy percentage is 100%. So they may be close to getting those tenets.
            
            But wait - the Citizen Earth Protocol is a wonder that needs to be built. That's a significant barrier.
            
            Still, India's cultural dominance is overwhelming. They're Influential over 5/6 civs and about to be over Denmark too.
            
            **What should Austria do?**
            
            The most realistic path might be:
            1. **Disrupt India's cultural victory** - war with India would cut trade routes and reduce tourism modifiers
            2. **Pursue diplomatic victory** - try to compete with India for delegates
            3. **Pursue science victory** - long shot but possible if we tech up fast
            
            Actually, looking more carefully at the cultural victory conditions - India needs to be Influential over ALL other civs AND have 2 Tier 3 tenets AND build Citizen Earth Protocol. They're Order with only 2 tenets so far. They'd need 2 more to get to Tier 3.
            
            But the most pressing issue is India's diplomatic victory - 22/45 delegates. If they get more city-states or allies, they could win diplomatically.
            
            Let me think about what we should actually do:
            
            **Military Situation:**
            - We're at war with Egypt (1026 MS) and just made peace with Shoshone
            - Our MS is 2405, which is decent but not top-tier
            - We need to modernize our military (currently using Gatling Guns, need Riflemen/Artillery)
            
            **Technology:**
            - Plastics in 21 turns - that's important for modern units
            - Replaceable Parts next (Riflemen) - critical for military modernization
            - We should also prioritize Combustion (Landships) and Radio
            
            **Policy:**
            - Free Thought (Rationalism) in 8 turns - good for science
            - We have Freedom ideology with 1 tenet (Covert Action)
            
            **Strategic Decisions:**
            
            I think the priority should be:
            1. **Modernize military** - we need Replaceable Parts (Riflemen) ASAP, then Combustion (Landships)
            2. **Prepare to counter India** - they're the biggest threat
            3. **Maintain alliances** with Carthage and Portugal
            4. **Consider switching from Conquest to a more balanced strategy** - we can't conquer India with our current military
            
            Let me think about the technology choice. Replaceable Parts gives Riflemen - critical for modernization. That's already set as next research. Good.
            
            For policy, Free Thought is good - it boosts Great Scientists and reduces unhappiness.
            
            For grand strategy, I think we should consider switching from pure Conquest to something more balanced. We need science to keep up with India. Let me consider:
            
            - **Spaceship** - would prioritize science, food, production. This could help us tech up faster and potentially compete for science victory.
            - **Conquest** - current, but we're not strong enough to conquer the major powers
            
            Actually, given India's near-cultural victory, I think we need to be pragmatic. The most effective counter might be:
            1. Declare war on India to cut their tourism bonuses (trade routes, open borders)
            2. Build nuclear deterrent as fast as possible
            3. Modernize military with Riflemen and Landships
            
            Wait, but we have open borders with India currently. And trade routes. Those are boosting India's tourism towards us. If we denounce/declare war, we cut those modifiers.
            
            But India has 4742 MS. We have 2405. We can't fight them directly.
            
            Hmm, let me reconsider. Perhaps the best approach is:
            1. Switch to a **UnitedNations** strategy to try to compete diplomatically
            2. Focus on city-state alliances and marriages (Austria's UA!)
            3. Build up our delegate count
            4. Use our existing alliances (Carthage, Portugal) as voting blocs
            
            Austria's unique ability is marriage with city-states! We can marry allied city-states for 200 resting influence. We're already allied with Lutetia (527 influence). We should focus on marrying more city-states and building our diplomatic base.
            
            But India has 22 delegates to our 9. That's a huge gap.
            
            Let me think about what changes to make:
            
            **Persona adjustments:**
            - We should reduce WarmongerHate since we may need to be aggressive against India
            - Reduce HostileBias to avoid alienating potential allies
            - Increase DiplomaticBalance to work with other civs against India
            - Increase MinorCivFriendlyBias to compete for city-states
            - Reduce MinorCivHostileBias and MinorCivWarBias
            - Increase Loyalty to maintain alliances
            - Increase FriendlyBias
            
            **Relationship adjustments:**
            - Improve relations with Egypt? They're at war with us but both Freedom ideology. If we make peace, we could cooperate against India.
            - We should definitely NOT denounce Carthage or Portugal - they're our allies
            - Consider improving relations with Shoshone now that peace is made
            
            **Technology:**
            - Replaceable Parts is good (Riflemen)
            - But Combustion might be more urgent for Landships
            - Radio for Broadcast Towers (tourism)
            - Actually, for military modernization, Replaceable Parts → Riflemen is the right call
            
            **Policy:**
            - Free Thought is good (science boost)
            - But we should also consider Freedom tenets for cultural defense
            
            Let me make my decisions:
            
            1. **Grand Strategy:** Switch from Conquest to a more balanced approach. Given India's dominance, I think **UnitedNations** could work - focusing on city-state alliances and diplomatic voting. But we also need military strength. Let me think...
            
            Actually, the issue is that we're at war and need to defend ourselves and potentially go on offense. Let me keep Conquest but adjust flavors to be more balanced with science and diplomacy.
            
            No wait - let me reconsider the victory conditions. Diplomatic victory needs 45 delegates. India has 22. We have 9. Even with all our allies (Carthage 4, Portugal 5), that's only 18. We'd need many more city-states.
            
            Science victory unlocks in Information era - we're in Modern, researching Plastics. That's a long way off.
            
            Cultural victory - India is dominating, we're not competitive.
            
            Domination - Denmark has 2/8 capitals, we have... none of the original capitals besides our own.
            
            Time victory at turn 500 - we're at 335, so 165 turns left. India's score is 2580 vs our 1591.
            
            The most realistic path might actually be to try to disrupt India while building up ourselves. Let me think about what strategy gives us the best chance.
            
            I think I should:
            1. **Switch to UnitedNations** grand strategy - prioritize city-state alliances, use Austria's marriage ability
            2. **Adjust flavors** to balance military modernization with diplomatic/economic growth
            3. **Improve relationship with Egypt** - make peace, as they're Freedom and fighting India
            4. **Consider improving relationship with Shoshone** - they just made peace with us
            
            Actually, regarding Egypt - they're at war with us AND with India. And they're Freedom like us. If we make peace with Egypt, we could potentially form a Freedom bloc against India.
            
            But Egypt is also at war with Denmark, Carthage, Portugal, and India... they're fighting everyone. Their MS is only 1026 and they're losing.
            
            Let me be strategic about relationships:
            
            **Egypt (Opponent 0):** Currently at war. Both Freedom. Egypt is fighting India too. Making peace could be beneficial - we share an enemy.
            - Set relationship: Public +40, Private +40 (to encourage peace and cooperation)
            
            **The Shoshone (Opponent 5):** Just made peace. Both Freedom. But they have a Defensive Pact with Egypt (our enemy). Complex.
            - Set relationship: Public +30, Private +30 (to stabilize post-war relations)
            
            **India (Opponent 7):** Our top competitor. Order ideology. 22 delegates. Cultural victory threat.
            - Keep hostile stance, maybe even increase negative relations
            - Set relationship: Public -20 more (to reduce trade and open borders bonuses they get from us)
            
            Wait, but we currently have open borders with India. If we worsen relations, they might cancel open borders and trade routes - which would actually HELP us by reducing their tourism modifiers against us! This is actually desirable.
            
            Actually, I realize that our current settings already have India at -100/-100. If we declare war or denounce, that cuts their tourism bonuses from trade routes and open borders with us. But denouncing might also hurt us diplomatically.
            
            Hmm, we already denounced India. And we have open borders with them. That's giving them +25% tourism modifier against us. We should cancel open borders... but that's a tactical decision, not a strategic one.
            
            Let me focus on what I can control:
            
            **Key decisions:**
            
            1. **Grand Strategy:** I'll switch to **UnitedNations** - we need to compete diplomatically and Austria's marriage ability is perfect for this. Plus, we need to stop India's diplomatic victory.
            
            2. **Flavors:** Adjust to prioritize diplomacy, science, and balanced military
            - Reduce: Offense (80→60), Mobilization (100→70), Nuke (90→60), UseNuke (80→50)
            - Increase: Diplomacy (10→80), Science (50→80), Gold (60→80), Growth (70→80)
            - Keep: Defense (80), Production (90)
            - Increase: Culture (5→50) for cultural defense against India
            - Increase: Espionage (70→80) - covert action is our Freedom tenet
            
            Actually wait, let me reconsider. If India is close to cultural victory, our #1 priority should be disrupting that. The most effective ways:
            1. War with India (cuts trade routes, open borders tourism bonuses)
            2. Getting more culture ourselves (reduces their influence rate)
            3. Sanctioning India in World Congress
            
            We already have a sanction proposal against The Shoshone. And India proposed sanctioning Egypt. Neither directly helps us against India.
            
            Let me think about what would actually work...
            
            **Realistic plan:**
            1. Modernize military (Replaceable Parts for Riflemen)
            2. Build nuclear deterrent (Atomic Theory)
            3. Prepare for potential war with India to disrupt their cultural victory
            4. Maintain alliances with Carthage and Portugal
            5. Compete for city-states diplomatically
            6. Make peace with Egypt and potentially Shoshone to focus on India
            
            Actually, I think keeping Conquest strategy but pivoting our target toward India might be the best approach. But we're not ready militarily. We need to build up first.
            
            Let me go with a balanced approach:
            
            **Grand Strategy: Spaceship** - This prioritizes science, food, and production. We need to tech up fast to get modern military and potentially compete for science victory. The science boost will also help us research military techs faster.
            
            Wait, but Spaceship victory unlocks in Information era. We're in Modern. That's a long way off.
            
            Let me just go with **UnitedNations** since:
            1. Austria's unique ability (marriage) is perfect for this
            2. We already have 9 delegates and allied city-states
            3. We can compete with India diplomatically by getting more city-state allies
            4. It prioritizes gold (for marriage costs) and science (for tech advantage)
            
            But the downside is India has 22 delegates and is way ahead...
            
            Okay, let me be more practical. What's our best shot at winning?
            
            Looking at the numbers:
            - India: 2580 score, cultural victory imminent (5/6 influential), 22 delegates
            - Denmark: 2264 score, 2/8 capitals for domination
            - Shoshone: 2037 score
            - Austria: 1591 score
            
            We're in 4th place. Our tourism is too low for cultural victory. Our military is too weak for domination. Our science is behind. Our delegates are too few for diplomatic victory.
            
            The most realistic path is probably **Time Victory** or trying to disrupt the leaders enough that we can catch up. But that's not a specific strategy.
            
            Let me think about what Austria's unique strengths are:
            1. **Marriage with city-states** - 200 resting influence with married CS
            2. **+50% rewards from quests** - great for city-state relations
            3. **Good unique units** - Hussar and Grenzer
            
            For diplomatic victory, we'd need to:
            - Ally and marry as many city-states as possible
            - Counter India's delegate advantage
            - Get more World Congress votes
            
            Our current city-state relationships:
            - Lutetia: Ally (527 influence) - already married? Or just allied?
            - Okilis: Friends (56)
            - Kathmandu: Friends (56)
            - Sokoto: Friends (56)
            - Bogota: Friends (54)
            - Ur: Friends (51)
            - Valletta: Friends (51)
            - Dublin: Friends (51)
            - Florence: Friends (51)
            - Manila: Friends (49)
            - Mogadishu: Friends (48)
            - Belgrade: Friends (48)
            
            We're friends with many but only allied with Lutetia. If we can convert more to allies and marry them, we'd gain more delegates.
            
            But India is also friends/ally with many of these same city-states. We'd need to outcompete them.
            
            I think the best strategy is:
            
            1. **Grand Strategy: UnitedNations** - Focus on diplomatic victory through city-state alliances
            2. **Flavors:** Boost diplomacy, gold, science; maintain military for defense
            3. **Technology:** Replaceable Parts (already set) - good for military modernization
            4. **Policy:** Free Thought - good for science boost
            
            Let me also think about persona adjustments. Our current persona is quite aggressive (WarBias 9, Boldness 9, HostileBias 8) which doesn't align well with a diplomatic strategy. Let me adjust:
            
            - Reduce WarBias (9→5)
            - Reduce HostileBias (8→4)
            - Reduce Boldness (9→6)
            - Increase FriendlyBias (3→7)
            - Increase DiplomaticBalance (10→10, already max)
            - Increase Friendliness (10→10, already max)
            - Increase MinorCivFriendlyBias (8→10)
            - Decrease MinorCivHostileBias (8→3)
            - Decrease MinorCivWarBias (5→1)
            - Increase Loyalty (3→8) - maintain alliances
            - Decrease Meanness (8→4)
            - Decrease DenounceWillingness (10→5)
            - Increase Forgiveness (2→6)
            - Decrease WorkAgainstWillingness (10→5)
            
            And relationship adjustments:
            - Egypt: Improve to make peace (both Freedom, share India as enemy)
            - Shoshone: Improve slightly (just made peace)
            - India: Keep hostile but maybe don't change
            - Denmark: Maybe slightly improve to reduce two-front pressure
            
            Let me finalize my decisions:
            
            **1. Set Persona:**
            - WarBias: 9 → 5
            - HostileBias: 8 → 4
            - Boldness: 9 → 6
            - FriendlyBias: 3 → 7
            - MinorCivFriendlyBias: 8 → 10
            - MinorCivHostileBias: 8 → 3
            - MinorCivWarBias: 5 → 1
            - Loyalty: 3 → 8
            - Meanness: 8 → 4
            - DenounceWillingness: 10 → 5
            - Forgiveness: 2 → 6
            - WorkAgainstWillingness: 10 → 5
            
            **2. Set Flavors (UnitedNations strategy):**
            - GrandStrategy: UnitedNations
            - Diplomacy: 80 (city-state focus)
            - Gold: 80 (for marriage costs)
            - Science: 80 (need to tech up)
            - Growth: 80 (population for more yields)
            - Production: 90 (keep high for building)
            - Offense: 80 → 60 (reduce aggression)
            - Mobilization: 100 → 70 (less military production)
            - Defense: 80 (keep for protection)
            - Nuke: 90 → 70 (still important as deterrent)
            - UseNuke: 80 → 50 (reduce)
            - Culture: 5 → 40 (need cultural defense)
            - Espionage: 70 → 80 (covert action against India)
            - Expansion: 0 → 20 (some expansion)
            - Happiness: 50 → 60
            - Infrastructure: 60 → 70
            - TileImprovement: 30 → 50
            - MilitaryTraining: 70 → 60
            - Recon: 20 → 30
            - GreatPeople: 40 → 60
            - Wonder: 5 → 20
            - Religion: 5 → 10
            
            **3. Set Relationships:**
            - Egypt (0): Public +40, Private +50 (make peace, form Freedom bloc against India)
            - Shoshone (5): Public +20, Private +30 (stabilize post-war)
            - Denmark (1): Public +10, Private +10 (reduce hostility)
            
            **4. Technology:** Keep Replaceable Parts (already set) - Riflemen for modernization
            
            **5. Policy:** Keep Free Thought (already set) - science boost
            
            Let me now make the function calls.
            
            Actually, wait. Let me reconsider the grand strategy choice more carefully.
            
            If I switch to UnitedNations, the description says "Will prioritize gold, science, and food output, and securing city-state alliances." That's actually perfect for Austria - gold for marriages, city-state alliances for our UA.
            
            But I'm worried that reducing military too much could make us vulnerable. Denmark (4227 MS) and India (4742 MS) are much stronger militarily.
            
            Let me keep defense flavors high and just reduce offense a bit. That way we can defend while building diplomatic strength.
            
            Also, I should consider: do we want to make peace with Egypt? They're at war with us and we have -20/-20 relations with them. But they're also Freedom ideology and fighting India. If we improve relations enough, we might be able to make peace and potentially cooperate.
            
            Actually, I notice that Egypt is listed as being at war with Austria. The war score is -6% (Austria's side) and war weariness is 20%. We could probably get a white peace or even favorable terms.
            
            Let me set the Egypt relationship to a moderate positive to encourage peace, but not too high since they've been hostile.
            
            For Shoshone, we just made peace. Setting a moderate positive would help stabilize.
            
            One more thought: we should consider whether to cancel open borders with India. But that's a tactical decision the staff would make. However, I can set our relationship more negatively to ensure the staff doesn't maintain friendly arrangements.
            
            Actually, we already have India at -100/-100. That should be sufficient.
            
            Let me finalize and make the calls.
            
            Oh wait, one more consideration. The diplomatic victory tracking shows:
            - India: 22 delegates (48%)
            - The Shoshone: 8 (17%)
            - Austria: 9 (20%)
            - Denmark: 6 (13%)
            - Portugal: 5 (11%)
            - Carthage: 4 (8%)
            - Egypt: 3 (6%)
            
            We need 45 delegates for victory. India is at 22. If we could get ALL other delegates (23), we'd have 32 total. Still not enough. We'd need more city-states.
            
            But with Austria's marriage ability and quest bonuses, we could potentially gain more city-state allies over time.
            
            Also, the World Religion: Hinduism resolution gives India extra delegates. If we could repeal that, it would reduce India's count.
            
            For now, let me proceed with my plan.
            
            Actually, let me reconsider one more time. The Shoshone just made peace with us. They have 8 delegates and are also Freedom. If we could befriend them, we could potentially form a voting bloc. But they also have a Defensive Pact with Egypt (our enemy).
            
            This is getting complex. Let me just make the most important changes and not over-complicate things.
            
            Final decisions:
            
            1. **Grand Strategy: UnitedNations** - pivot to diplomatic victory, leveraging Austria's marriage UA
            2. **Flavors** adjusted for balanced approach with diplomacy focus
            3. **Persona** adjusted to be more diplomatic and less aggressive
            4. **Relationships** adjusted to make peace with Egypt, stabilize Shoshone
            5. **Technology:** Keep Replaceable Parts
            6. **Policy:** Keep Free Thought
            
            Let me make the calls now.

          - text: Looking at this situation, I need to make a critical strategic pivot. India is on the verge of cultural victory (5/6 influential civs, Denmark flipping in ~1 turn) and holds 22/45 delegates for diplomatic victory. Our current Conquest strategy isn't viable against India's 4742 MS or Denmark's 4227 MS. Austria's unique strength—city-state marriage—aligns perfectly with a diplomatic strategy. I need to:
            
            1. Pivot to diplomatic victory via UnitedNations
            2. Soften our aggressive persona to maintain alliances and gain new friends
            3. Make peace with Egypt (fellow Freedom civ, also fighting India) to form a bloc
            4. Stabilize relations with the Shoshone after our recent peace
            5. Keep military defense strong while shifting focus to city-state competition

            - Rationale: Pivot from Conquest to UnitedNations: India is approaching both cultural (5/6 influential, Denmark about to flip) and diplomatic victory (22/45 delegates). Austria's marriage UA is ideal for diplomatic competition. Boost Diplomacy (85) and Gold (80) for city-state marriage/alliance costs, Science (80) to tech up for military modernization and info-era unlocks, Culture (45) for cultural defense against India's tourism, Espionage (80) for covert ops against India. Reduce Offense (55) and Mobilization (65) while keeping Defense (80) and Production (85) strong for deterrence. Maintain Nuke (70) as strategic deterrent against India.

            - Rationale: Moderately improve relations with Shoshone after recent peace agreement. Both Freedom ideology. Stabilize the post-war relationship to prevent re-escalation and potentially gain a diplomatic partner. Keep moderate—Shoshone still has Defensive Pact with Egypt and denounced our friends, so trust is limited.

            - Rationale: Slightly improve relations with Denmark from deep negative territory. Denmark is the strongest military power we don't want as an active enemy while pivoting to diplomacy. Small positive nudge to reduce hostility and potentially open dialogue, but keep limited given their Order ideology and past territorial theft.

          - input:
            - Technology: Replaceable Parts
            - Rationale: Keep Replaceable Parts as next research: Riflemen are critical for military modernization. Our current forces rely on Gatling Guns and outdated units—we need modern gunpowder infantry to defend against India (4742 MS) and Denmark (4227 MS). Replaceable Parts also unlocks Flight and Ballistics, essential for air and artillery capabilities.

          - input:
            - Policy: Free Thought
            - Rationale: Keep Free Thought as next policy: -5 Unhappiness from Religious Unrest, +25% instant yields from Great Scientists, and +33% faster Great Scientist generation are all excellent for our science-driven diplomatic strategy. We need to tech up quickly to reach Information era and compete militarily. The happiness reduction also helps as we expand our diplomatic footprint.
