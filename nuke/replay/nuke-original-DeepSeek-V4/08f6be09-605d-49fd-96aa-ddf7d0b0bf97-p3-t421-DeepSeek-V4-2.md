  - rationale: Emergency authorization for nuclear weapon deployment to defend Tenochtitlan. Enemy forces (6,200 strength) more than double our defenders (2,700), creating existential threat to our second capital. Atomic Bomb completes in 2 turns in Baghdad - enabling maximum nuclear use probability ensures it will be deployed immediately against concentrated enemy forces threatening the city. This is essential to hold Tenochtitlan for the final 8+ turns until Cultural Victory completion. All other defensive priorities (Defense 100, CityDefense 100, Production 100, Wonder 100) remain unchanged.

  - system:
    - You are an expert player playing Civilization V with the latest Vox Populi mod.
      
      # Expectation
      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - You can ask your specialized briefers to prepare focused reports (only for) the next turn by calling the `focus-briefer` tool.
        - You have three specialized briefers: Military, Economy, and Diplomacy analysts.
        - Only ask for information relevant to the macro-level decisions in your control. 
       - Your briefer(s) ONLY have limited information of the current game state.
        - Your briefer(s) DO NOT have control over tactical decisions and cannot predict tactical AI's next decision.
        - Your briefer(s) ARE BEST on summarizing and synthesizing factual information, NOT analyzing, projecting, or predicting.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:
        - Domination Victory: Control or vassalize all original capitals.
          - Vassals cannot achieve a domination victory before independence.
        - Science Victory: Be the first to produce all spaceship parts and launch the spaceship.

          - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
        - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
          - In Vox Populi, envoys/diplomats/etc is a unit produced or purchased for a one-time influence gain with a city state.

        - Neediness: 6
        - Chattiness: 9
        - DeceptiveBias: 4
        - Rationale: Tweaked by In-Game AI (Adjusting persona after accepting America will not peace despite 6+ turns of maximum effort. Reducing Neediness from 10 to 6 and FriendlyBias from 10 to 8 - maintaining cooperative stance but removing desperate, pleading character that failed to produce results. Increasing Boldness slightly from 1 to 3 to reflect confidence in eventual victory and willingness to defend Tenochtitlan assertively. Maintaining Forgiveness 10 and Meanness 1 to remain non-threatening to other civs. Focus now on dignified endurance through 8+ turn victory timeline rather than desperate peace-seeking.)
        
        ## Technology
        - Next: The Internet
        - Rationale: After Satellites completes (13 turns), The Internet provides 50% tourism boost toward Cultural Victory and unlocks Nanotechnology, Particle Physics, and Globalization - all prerequisites on the path to Future Tech needed for Citizen Earth Protocol. Tourism boost may also help with any remaining cultural influence gaps while researching toward the end-game techs.
        
        ## Policy
        - Next: Great Leap Forward (Policy)
        - Rationale: As a Level 2 Order tenet with 7 Order policies already adopted, Great Leap Forward provides a free technology - critical for bypassing one of the expensive late-game techs on the path to Future Tech. With victory 8+ turns away and each tech taking 10+ turns, saving 10-13 turns of research is essential. This accelerates access to Future Tech and thus Citizen Earth Protocol construction.
        
        ## Relationships
        
        ### Shedet
        - Public: 25
        - Private: 20
        - Rationale: Reducing Shedet priority from 35/30 to 25/20. Ally status very secure at 270 influence, no competitors visible. Stable delegate allows continued focus on Bunkeya acquisition and Shanghai defense.
        - UpdatedTurn: 204
        
        ### Antwerp
        - Public: 25
        - Private: 20
        - Rationale: Reducing Antwerp priority from 35/30 to 25/20. Ally status secure at 84 influence with America at -48. Stable situation permits focus on more urgent Shanghai protection and Bunkeya acquisition.
        - UpdatedTurn: 204
        
        ### Bunkeya
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: ABANDONING Bunkeya investment. Inca influence at 295 vs our 52 with only 13 turns until voting - mathematically impossible to overcome. Morocco providing zero support. Redirecting all diplomatic resources to protect existing allies (Shanghai, Dublin, Shedet, Zuunmod, Ife, Vilnius, Nippur) rather than wasting effort on lost cause.
        - UpdatedTurn: 229
        
        ### Shanghai
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Abandoning Shanghai contest. Inca has 63 influence vs our 7; while closer gap than Ife, expenditure not justified when already controlling 5 city-state delegates and pursuing Cultural Victory.
        - UpdatedTurn: 242
        
        ### Zuunmod
        - Public: 35
        - Private: 30
        - Rationale: Increasing priority from 25/20 to 35/30 to ensure Ally status (236 influence) remains secure despite technical war state induced by Casus Belli resolution. Delegate critical for World Congress voting; maintaining positive relations prevents influence decay or alliance break.
        - UpdatedTurn: 248
        
        ### The Ottomans
        - Public: 25
        - Private: 20
        - Rationale: Maintaining 25/20 with Ottomans. Peace treaty active until turn 277 (after projected victory turn 276). Moderate positive relations maintain stability without over-investing diplomatic capital during final push.
        - UpdatedTurn: 272
        
        ### The Aztecs
        - Public: 45
        - Private: 40
        - Rationale: Maintaining elevated 45/40 stance with Aztecs. War score at 82% is excellent, weariness only 5%. However, with victory 15-20 turns away, keeping options open for peace if they capitulate. They remain denounced and war continues, but maintaining diplomatic channel for potential quick resolution to free military supply.
        - UpdatedTurn: 341
        
        ### Ethiopia
        - Public: 60
        - Private: 55
        - Rationale: Reducing Ethiopia from 85/80 to 60/55. As Inca's vassal with 3 delegates, they vote with Inca regardless of our relations. High investment yielded no returns. Reduced but positive stance maintains optionality if vassalage breaks, but frees diplomatic focus for more productive channels.
        - UpdatedTurn: 376
        
        ### Ife
        - Public: 0
        - Private: 0
        - Rationale: Ife is at war with Arabia (influence -37) and ally of The Inca. Mathematically impossible to convert before vote. Zeroing out to redirect diplomatic resources.
        - UpdatedTurn: 379
        
        ### Nippur
        - Public: 30
        - Private: 25
        - Rationale: Delegate majority now secured at 54 votes (above 44 threshold) through Morocco, Huns, Ethiopia, and city-states. Reducing Nippur from emergency 100/95 to 30/25 since Inca's World Leader proposal at Turn 392 can now be blocked without Nippur's additional delegates.
        - UpdatedTurn: 388
        
        ### Bucharest
        - Public: 40
        - Private: 35
        - Rationale: Bucharest is second most critical - provides 12 delegates. Reducing from previous emergency levels but maintaining 40/35 to ensure absolute security. Currently at war with America (influence -60 for them) which protects my Ally status, but must ensure no diplomatic incidents. Losing Bucharest would drop delegate count to 36, below threshold.
        - UpdatedTurn: 396
        
        ### Morocco
        - Public: 55
        - Private: 50
        - Rationale: Slightly increasing Morocco from 50/45 to 55/50. They have 28 delegates and peace treaty expires Turn 408. Even temporary defensive pact could block Inca's World Leader aspirations if they call vote at Turn 405. Also removes war distraction freeing mental bandwidth for Cultural Victory push. Worth testing if higher priority yields diplomatic opening without diverting focus from America.
        - UpdatedTurn: 405
        
        ### The Huns
        - Public: 65
        - Private: 60
        - Rationale: Reducing Huns from 70/65 to 65/60. They share Order ideology and provide 5 delegates, but I've determined they will likely vote with me anyway due to shared ideology and my positive stance. Freeing some diplomatic capital for Morocco outreach. With 48 delegates secured through my own + Dublin + Shedet + Bucharest, Huns support is helpful but not critical.

        ### The Inca
        - Public: 10
        - Private: 5
        - Rationale: Slight increase from 5/0 to 10/5 with Inca. Not antagonistic, not friendly. Victory is 1-2 turns away with International Games active - no need to provoke them, but also no reason to invest diplomatic capital. They may call World Leader vote but I can no longer block with only ~32 delegates. Guarded neutrality and avoiding any incidents is optimal for the final turn(s).
        - UpdatedTurn: 406
        
        ### America
        - Public: 20
        - Private: 15
        - Rationale: Reducing America from 100/95 to 20/15 after 6+ turns of maximum friendly stance with zero reciprocation. Their war weariness (26%) and negative GPT (-115) should motivate peace, but ideology difference (-999) and denunciation appear insurmountable barriers. With victory now 8+ turns away and Tenochtitlan vulnerable, accepting that peace is unattainable and reallocating diplomatic focus to defense and critical ally maintenance. This frees diplomatic 'bandwidth' for more productive relationships.
        - UpdatedTurn: 419
        
        ### Dublin
        - Public: 100
        - Private: 95
        - Rationale: Maintaining maximum 100/95 stance with Dublin. Dublin is now my SOLE remaining city-state ally (763 influence) providing critical delegate for World Congress. All other former allies (Bucharest, Shedet, Bunkeya, Palatium, Belgrade, Ife, Yerevan, Nippur) are now at war with me. Dublin's 3 delegates via Sphere of Influence are irreplaceable. With 8+ turns until victory, must ensure absolutely no diplomatic incidents, coups, or influence decay occurs. Dublin is surrounded by enemies but my naval presence provides protection.
        - UpdatedTurn: 419
        
        ### Novgorod
        - Public: 35
        - Private: 30
        - Rationale: Increasing Novgorod from baseline to 35/30. Novgorod is my ONLY remaining friendly city-state (160 influence, Friends status) besides Dublin. They provide +1 friendly vote in World Congress. With all other city-states now hostile due to war, maintaining Novgorod's friendship is critical for any remaining diplomatic leverage. Need to ensure they don't drop below 40 influence or become hostile due to the general war contagion.
        - UpdatedTurn: 419
        
        ## Strategy
        - Rationale: Maximum defensive posture (Defense 100, CityDefense 100) to save Tenochtitlan from imminent threat - enemy forces 6.2K vs our 2.7K strength is critical. Maintaining Production 100, Wonder 100, Culture 100 to rush-build Citizen Earth Protocol once Future Tech is unlocked. Reduced Science to 30 since Satellites takes 13 turns regardless. Gold 80 allows emergency unit purchases if Tenochtitlan requires immediate reinforcement. All offensive military flavors at 0 - survival and wonder construction are the only priorities for the final 8+ turns.

        # Briefings
        ## Military Briefing
        (Produced with your instruction: Critical focus on Tenochtitlan defense - the city faces severe threat with enemy strength at 6,200 vs our 2,700. Prioritize emergency unit repositioning, consider deploying the newly produced Atomic Bomb from Najran if enemy forces concentrate in viable targets, and evaluate whether Tenochtitlan can hold for 8+ turns until victory. Baghdad sea zone and Damascus also require monitoring but Tenochtitlan is existential - losing it eliminates our second capital and may prevent victory.)
        
        **Arabia – Military Situation Briefing**  
        *Post‑Turn 420* – for Harun al‑Rashid (Player 3)

        ### 1. Tactical Overview – Tenochtitlan (City ID 15061)
        
        - **Current Friendly Strength:** ≈ 2 700 (1 Tank, 1 Infantry, 1 Machine Gun, 1 Hashemite Raider, plus city defenses).  
        - **Current Enemy Strength in Zone:** ≈ 6 200 (Moroccan units: 1 Machine Gun, 1 Rifleman; additional hostile forces reported from America and other actors are outside the immediate zone).  
        - **Posture:** Hedgehog (enemy‑dominant). The zone’s **ZoneValue** remains high (480), indicating strategic importance and heavy enemy concentration.  
        - **Health of Defenders:** All garrison units are above 70 % HP; the city’s defensive strength is 161 (own) vs. 5 084 (enemy) as reported in the zone report. No recent combat reports indicate losses in this zone since the last briefing.  
        
        **Change Since Turn 415:** Enemy presence has increased from negligible (no enemy units in the zone) to a solid enemy force exceeding our strength by more than 2 : 1. No additional Arabian units have been stationed here during the interval.

        | **Medina** (ID 1229) | 6 302 | 3 752 | Even, counter‑attack posture. |
        | **Damascus** (ID 1463) | 2 610 | 6 412 | Hedgehog, enemy‑dominant; heavy American pressure. |
        | **Baghdad Sea** (‑1546) | 2 443 | 5 826 | Enemy‑dominant (American destroyers/dreadnoughts). |
        | **Najran** (ID 3005) | 5 296 | 2 775 | Friendly‑dominant, counter‑attack posture. |
        
        Tenochtitlan is the only Arabian city where the enemy outnumbers us decisively and where the zone is marked as enemy‑dominant.
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. Recent Combat & Unit Attrition (Turn 419‑420)
        
        - **Arabian Losses:**  
          - 1 Fighter (killed by Morocco).  
          - 1 Hashemite Raider (killed by Morocco).  
          - 1 Infantry (killed by Morocco).  
          - 1 Machine Gun (killed by America).  
          - 2 Great Generals captured by America (both killed in the same combat).  
        - **Moroccan Gains:** Promotion of Triplane to *Air Supremacy II* and creation of a new Fighter; a Caravan produced in Rabat.  
        - **American Activity:** Produced a Fighter and promoted a Tank (Blitz); heavy air and naval units remain active near our coastal and frontier tiles.  
        - **Atomic Bomb Production:** Completed in Baghdad (2 turns remaining to finish). No nuclear detonation has occurred yet.  
        
        No combat directly involved Tenochtitlan during these turns, but the zone’s enemy strength has risen, reflecting possible reinforcement movements from Morocco and America.
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. Supply & Force Composition (Turn 420)
        
        - **Total Units:** 50 (Land ≈ 38, Air ≈ 7, Sea ≈ 5).  
        - **Supply Used:** 55 / ? (near cap; limited spare capacity).  
        - **Land Forces:** 5 Tanks (including 1 in Mecca), 3 Artillery, 12 Infantry/Riflemen, 7 Machine Guns, 5 Hashemite Raiders.  
        - **Air Forces:** 4 Triplanes (all fully promoted), 1 Heavy Bomber (newly produced), 1 Fighter (newly produced).  
        - **Naval Forces:** 2 Destroyers (Arabian), no capital ships.  
        
        The only reserve air unit capable of strategic strike is the Heavy Bomber (ID 18477) currently stationed in Damascus; the Atomic Bomb (ID 18424) is pending final turn of production.
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Threat Assessment – Immediate
        
        - **Primary Threat:** Sustained enemy pressure on Tenochtitlan. Enemy strength (≈ 6 200) exceeds friendly strength (≈ 2 700) by a factor of > 2. The zone’s “Hedgehog” designation implies the enemy holds the tactical advantage and may attempt a breakthrough.  
        - **Secondary Threats:**  
          - **Damascus** – enemy strength (≈ 6 400) vs. our 2 610, with American units present (Tank, AA, Infantry).  
          - **Baghdad Sea** – enemy naval superiority (≈ 5 800) vs. our 2 443, though the enemy fleet is limited to destroyers and dreadnoughts.  
          - **Moroccan Air** – recent upgrades (Triplane with *Air Supremacy II*) increase anti‑air capability near our frontier cities.  
        
        All other Arabian cities retain friendly‑dominant or at least even positions.
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. Force Status Relative to Past Briefing (Turn 415)
        
        | Metric | Turn 415 | Turn 420 | Delta |
        |--------|----------|----------|-------|
        | **Total Friendly Strength (global)** | 13 950 | 13 950 (unchanged) |
        | **Units Lost (cumulative)** | – (minor) | 5 ground units (1 Fighter, 1 Raider, 1 Infantry, 1 Machine Gun) + 2 Great Generals |
        | **Atomic Bomb Production** | Not started | In‑production (2 turns to complete) |
        | **Tenochtitlan Friendly Strength** | 2 905 | 2 700 (slight reduction due to unit attrition elsewhere) |
        | **Tenochtitlan Enemy Strength** | ~0 (no enemy units) | ~6 200 (enemy‑dominant) |
        | **Supply Usage** | 55 (near cap) | 55 (stable) |
        
        The most significant shift is the emergence of a heavy enemy concentration on Tenochtitlan, while all other fronts remain largely unchanged.
        
        ---
        
        ### 7. Strategic Assets Available
        
        - **Heavy Bomber** (Mecca‑produced, now in Damascus) – fully promoted for air targeting.  
        - **Atomic Bomb** – poised to become operational from Baghdad in two turns.  
        - **Triplanes** – four units, all at *Air Supremacy II* after recent promotion.  
        - **Naval Destroyer** – singular Arabian destroyer active near the coast (coastal defense against naval incursions).  
        
        These assets are the only means capable of delivering high‑damage strikes on concentrated enemy forces outside of direct ground combat.  
        
        --- 
        
        **End of Briefing**.
        
        ## Economy Briefing
        (Produced with your instruction: Focus on preparing production infrastructure in Mecca for rapid Citizen Earth Protocol construction once Future Tech is researched. With all cities currently building military units, evaluate when to switch Mecca or other high-production cities to the victory wonder. Check Great Engineer availability for wonder rush capability. Current +347 GPT and 514 treasury allows emergency purchases if Tenochtitlan defense requires immediate unit buys.)
        
        **Arabia – Economic Briefing (Post‑Turn 420)**  
        *Prepared for Harun al‑Rashid – Macro‑Level Overview*  
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Treasury & Gold Flow  
        
        - **Current Treasury:** **514 G** – down 273 G from turn 415.  
        - **Gold per Turn (GPT):** **+347 G/t** (increase of +53 G/t vs. turn 415, mainly from the Mecca → Dublin gold route and higher city‑level gold yields).  
        - **Liquidity Outlook:** At +347 G/t the treasury will be replenished within **≈ 2 turns** if the current rate holds. No deficit is apparent; however, any spike in maintenance (e.g., large unit purchases) will immediately erode the buffer.
        
        ---
        
        ### 2. Production Capacity – High‑Output Cities  
        
        | City | Production / Turn | Current Build | Notes |
        |------|-------------------|---------------|-------|
        | **Mecca** | **610 P/t** | Heavy Bomber (2 t left) → **Citizen Earth Protocol** (future) | Highest base production; already equipped with a production‑focused trade route (Mecca → Damascus / Najran) delivering +49 P/t each. |
        | **Baghdad** | 275 P/t | Atomic Bomb (2 t left) | Moderate output; coastal, can add naval production later. |
        | **Damascus** | 486 P/t | Military Base (3 t) | Strong output but tied to current military build queue. |
        | **Najran** | 493 P/t | Infantry (1 t) | Production surplus once infantry finishes. |
        | **Calixtlahuaca** | 148 P/t (post‑radiation) | Heavy Bomber (3 t) | Reduced population after fallout, lower output. |
        | **Tenochtitlan** | 246 P/t | Strategic Defense System (1 t) | Limited growth; recently converted to Islam. |
        
        **Implication:** Mecca remains the single city capable of delivering the >600 P/t required for rapid **Citizen Earth Protocol** construction once the prerequisite Future technology (e.g., **Robotics** → **Future Tech**) is unlocked.  
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. Great Engineer Availability  
        
        - **Great Engineers (GE) earned:** **2** (both already expended on **Research Lab** projects in Istanbul and Istanbul/Mecca earlier in the game).  
        - **Current GE pool:** **0** – no unspent Great Engineers remain.  
        - **Generation rate:** With **+1868 S/t** and **+2459 C/t**, the next GE is projected within **≈ 12 turns** (based on standard GE‑point accumulation).  
        
        **Effect on Wonder Rush:** Without a spare GE, a direct “spend GE” rush for the **Citizen Earth Protocol** is unavailable. The only viable acceleration path is to allocate Mecca’s production after the current Heavy Bomber finishes (turn 422) and keep the city dedicated to the wonder.
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. Timing for Production Switch  
        
        1. **Turn 422:** Heavy Bomber completes in Mecca.  
        2. **Turn 423‑424:** Immediate switch of Mecca’s production queue to **Citizen Earth Protocol** (once the Future tech prerequisite is satisfied).  
        3. **Turn 425‑??:** Mecca will sustain >600 P/t, completing the wonder in **≈ 2 turns** after the tech is available (the protocol requires **1200 P** total).  
        
        - **Alternative city (Damascus)** could take over if Mecca is needed for a critical unit (e.g., air unit after Radar completion). Damascus provides 486 P/t, which would extend the wonder build time by roughly **+2 turns** relative to Mecca.  
        
        - **Najran** (493 P/t) is a secondary option, same extension as Damascus.
        
        **Conclusion:** Keep Mecca dedicated to the wonder immediately after the bomber; a switch away would delay completion by 2–3 turns.
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Military Production Pressure  
        
        - **Current unit queue:** All cities are constructing military units (Heavy Bomber, Infantry, Strategic Defense System).  
        - **Treasury buffer (514 G) + GPT (+347 G/t)** comfortably covers the **+48 G/t** gold cost of immediate unit purchases (e.g., if Tenochtitlan needs a defender).  
        - **Maintenance:** The active *Casus Belli* resolution continues to reduce unit upkeep by **15 %**, further protecting the treasury.
        
        **Emergency Purchase Capacity:**  
        - With **≈ 600 G** available (treasury + next turn’s GPT), you can afford the full **price of a single Infantry** (≈ 45 G) or **Fighter** (≈ 200 G) without jeopardizing the later wonder schedule.
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. Trade‑Route Yield Summary  
        
        | Origin → Destination | Primary Yield | Net per Turn |
        |----------------------|----------------|--------------|
        | Mecca → Dublin (Ally) | Gold | **+48.6 G/t** |
        | Mecca → Damascus | Production | **+49 P/t** |
        | Mecca → Najran | Production | **+49 P/t** |
        | Mecca → Tenochtitlan | Food | **+68 F/t** |
        | Mecca → Calixtlahuaca | Food | **+66.6 F/t** |
        | Mecca → Baghdad | Food | **+66.6 F/t** |
        | Remaining free route slot: **1** (all major civs are at war, limiting new foreign connections).  
        
        **Key Point:** The gold‑producing route to Dublin is the sole source of external income; its stability is crucial for maintaining the current GPT level.
        
        ---
        
        ### 7. Resource Liquidation Potential  
        
        | Resource | Qty | Approx. Sale Value |
        |----------|-----|-------------------|
        | Aluminum | 21 | ~42 G |
        | Coal | 9 | ~9 G |
        | Iron | 1 | ~1 G |
        | Silk | 3 | ~9 G |
        | Jade | 9 | ~18 G |
        | Amber | 3 | ~6 G |
        | Uranium | 2 | ~4 G |
        | **Total immediate liquid‑ation** | – | **≈ 89 G** |
        
        Liquidating all surplus resources would add a modest **≈ 90 G** to the treasury—useful for a one‑off purchase but not essential given the current GPT surplus.
        
        ---
        
        ### 8. Summary of Economic Position  
        
        - **Liquidity:** Positive flow; treasury comfortably above 500 G, no imminent shortfall.  
        - **Production:** Mecca is the only city able to finish the **Citizen Earth Protocol** quickly once the Future tech is researched.  
        - **Great Engineers:** None available; wonder rush must rely on Mecca’s high production rather than a GE spend.  
        - **Military:** All cities are unit‑focused; the treasury can absorb a single emergency unit purchase without impacting the wonder schedule.  
        - **Trade:** Gold income hinges on the Mecca → Dublin route; protecting that alliance remains economically strategic.  
        
        **Operational Implication:** Maintain Mecca’s production on the wonder starting turn 423, keep Damascus and Najran on military builds, and monitor the completion of the required Future technology (Robotics → Future Tech). No additional settlement is required at this stage; focus resources on securing the prerequisite tech and preserving the gold trade route.
        
        ## Diplomacy Briefing
        (Produced with your instruction: Monitor Dublin's security as our sole remaining ally providing 12 critical delegates via Sphere of Influence. With all major civs at war and war-weariness rising (52% vs America), watch for any unexpected peace overtures despite low probability. Track Novgorod (157 influence, Friends) to ensure they don't drop below 40 and become hostile. The Inca has 48 delegates - monitor if they call World Leader vote in 8 turns, though we cannot block with only 15 delegates.)
        
        **Arabia – Diplomatic Briefing (Turn 420)**  
        *Prepared for Harun al‑Rashid*  
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Major Diplomatic Developments (since Turn 415)
        
        | Civ / City‑State | Current Status | Change Since Turn 415 |
        |------------------|----------------|-----------------------|
        | **America**      | War, denounced, war‑weariness **≈56 %** (up from ≈45 %). | No peace offer; war intensity increased. |
        | **Morocco**      | War, denounced, war‑weariness **≈26 %** (up from ≈15 %). | Nuclear strike on Calixtlahuaca (Arabian city) – ‘Nuked Arabia’ flag remains. |
        | **Ethiopia**     | War, denounced, war‑weariness **≈0 %** (unchanged). | No new activity. |
        | **The Inca**     | War, denounced, war‑weariness **≈1 %** (unchanged). | No new activity. |
        | **Dublin (CS)**  | **Ally (protected)** – Influence **943**, **+12 delegates**. Quest *Liberate Antwerp* now **15 turns** left. | Influence rose (from 813) after successful **Sphere‑of‑Influence** proposal; remains only high‑influence ally. |
        | **Bucharest (CS)** | **War** – Influence **‑60**, no ally status. | Lost protected‑ally status (previously ally), now hostile. |
        | **Novgorod (CS)** | **Friends** – Influence **395** (≈157 effective after Open Door). | Influence stable; still above 40, no risk of becoming hostile. |
        | **Other CS** (Shedet, Belgrade, Ife, Nippur, Yerevan, Palatium, Vatican, Vilnius, etc.) | **War** (or neutral) – Influence **‑60**. | No change. |
        
        **Key events since Turn 415**  
        
        * Turn 419 – Morocco detonated a nuclear weapon on Arabian city **Calixtlahuaca** (plains, railroad). The city survived; Islam remained the dominant religion.  
        * Turn 420 – Two Arab cities (**Tenochtitlan**, **Calixtlahuaca**) reaffirmed **Islam** (religion conversion events). No new religious spread affecting other civs.  
        * No diplomatic proposals or peace offers have appeared despite elevated war‑weariness across all fronts.
        
        ---
        
        ### 2. World‑Congress Outlook (Voting in 7 turns)
        
        | Proposal | Proposer | Effect | Current Support Landscape |
        |----------|----------|--------|----------------------------|
        | **Decolonization** (Arabia) | Arabia | Sets all civ‑city‑state influence to 50 (except permanent allies). Reduces rival delegates from city‑states. | **Arabia** 27 delegates (15 base + 12 from Dublin). Needs **≥43** votes → must secure at least two additional supporters (most plausible: Ethiopia (6) and possibly a neutral CS). |
        | **World Ideology: Freedom** (The Inca) | The Inca | Grants extra delegates to Freedom‑aligned civs (Morocco, America). Enables Diplomatic Victory once UN built. | **Inca** 48 delegates (dominant). Likely to pass, bolstering Freedom‑aligned rivals. |
        | **Global Hegemony** (automatic) | — | Determines leader for Diplomatic Victory if enough delegate support. | Inca leading with 48 delegates; Arabia far behind. |
        | **Open Door: Vilnius** (active) | — | All civs set to 40 influence with Vilnius; no ally can be formed while active. | No immediate impact on our core allies. |
        | **Active Resolutions** – *Casus Belli*, *Natural Heritage Sites*, *Arabian Sphere of Influence (Dublin)* – remain in force.
        
        **Delegate totals (effective voting power):**  
        
        - **Arabia:** 15 base + 12 (Dublin) = **27**  
        - **The Inca:** **48** (dominant)  
        - **Morocco:** **30** (Freedom‑aligned)  
        - **America:** **15** (Freedom‑aligned)  
        - **Ethiopia:** **6**  
        
        *Threshold to pass a resolution = 43 votes.* Arabia’s Decolonization will require at least two additional civs (Ethiopia plus one more) or negotiation for a CS to switch from war to neutral/ally.
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. City‑State Relationships & Quests
        
        | City‑State | Relation | Influence | Quest(s) | Note |
        |------------|----------|-----------|----------|------|
        | **Dublin** | Ally (protected) | **943** (≈+12 delegates) | *Liberate Antwerp* – **15 turns** left → **+287 inf**, **+4 happiness** in capital. | Critical ally; ensure quest completion to keep high influence. |
        | **Novgorod** | Friends | **395** (≈157 effective) | None | Influence comfortably above 40; monitor for any future Open‑Door proposals that could force a reset. |
        | **Bucharest** | War | –60 | None | Lost ally status; no diplomatic benefit. |
        | **All other CS** | War / Neutral | –60 or low | None | No quests pending; stay aware of any future proposals that could alter influence. |
        
        **Overall:** Dublin is the sole high‑influence ally providing delegates; protecting this relationship (completing its quest, maintaining influence > 800) is essential for any World‑Congress leverage.
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. Religion Situation
        
        - **Arabia:** Islam dominates all 7 cities – no conversion changes.  
        - **Morocco:** Majority Buddhism; **Fes** (23 pop) recently converted to **Islam** (Turn 415). No diplomatic penalty beyond existing religious strain.  
        - **The Inca:** Predominantly Catholicism; several coastal cities now **Tengriist** (no direct effect on us).  
        - **America:** Islam (all major cities).  
        - **Ethiopia:** Catholicism (capital Harar).  
        
        *Religious differences continue to generate a **‑30** opinion penalty with The Inca and Morocco; no new religious events have altered this landscape.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 5. Espionage Activity (last 5 turns)
        
        | Spy (Owner) | Location | Activity |
        |-------------|----------|----------|
        | **Gharib** (Arabia) | Fes (Morocco) | Gathering intelligence – maintains Moroccan suspicion (‑33 opinion). |
        | **Zarafah** (Arabia) | Rabat (Morocco) | Same as above. |
        | **Hisham** (Arabia) | Washington (America) | Gathering intelligence – contributes to American distrust. |
        | **Khenzeer** (Arabia) | Ouarzazate (Morocco) | Gathering intelligence – adds to Moroccan tension. |
        | **Fahima** (Arabia) | Lalibela (Ethiopia) | Gathering intelligence – Ethiopian suspicion present. |
        | **Yusuf** (Arabia) | Cusco (The Inca) | Gathering intelligence – Inca suspicion present. |
        | **Others** (Morocco, America) – no new captures reported. |
        
        *No spy captures occurred this turn; existing penalties for “spies caught” remain in force.*
        
        ---
        
        ### 6. Comparison with Turn 415 Briefing
        
        | Item | Turn 415 | Turn 420 | Δ |
        |------|----------|----------|---|
        | **War‑weariness** (average) | ≈45 % (America) / 15 % (Morocco) | **≈56 %** (America) / **≈26 %** (Morocco) | War fatigue rising sharply on both fronts. |
        | **Delegates (effective)** | 27 (15 + 12 from Dublin) + 1 from Bucharest = **28** | **27** (loss of Bucharest ally) | −1 delegate. |
        | **City‑state allies** | Dublin **and** Bucharest (both protected) | Only **Dublin** remains protected; Bucharest now at war. |
        | **World‑Congress proposals** | Decolonization pending vote next turn; Inca Freedom Ideology pending. | Same proposals now **voting** in 7 turns; no new proposals. |
        | **Dublin influence** | 813 | **943** (increase after successful Sphere‑of‑Influence) | Strengthened ally. |
        | **Novgorod influence** | 170 (Friends) | **395** (Friends) – still safe above 40. |
        | **Espionage** | Two Arabian spies caught in Morocco; Moroccan spy caught in America. | Same spy network persists; no new captures. |
        | **Religion** | No conversions affecting us. | Two Arab cities reaffirmed Islam; Morocco’s Fes converted to Islam (internal). |
        | **Major events** | None. | Morocco’s nuclear strike on Calixtlahuaca (Turn 419). |
        
        **Key take‑aways:**  
        
        - **Delegate power has slipped** due to loss of Bucharest; only Dublin supplies critical delegates.  
        - **War‑weariness** on all fronts is climbing, especially against America.  
        - **World‑Congress voting** is imminent; without securing extra supporters, Decolonization is unlikely to pass.  
        - **Dublin remains vital** – completing its Antwerp quest solidifies our delegate edge and yields happiness.  
        - **Espionage tension** stays high with Morocco, America, Ethiopia, and The Inca; no new captures, but penalties persist.

      - Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
      - The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
      - You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
      - There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
      - You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
      - Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
      - The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
      - Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.
      
      # Goals
      Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
      - For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
      - Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
        - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
      - You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the `set-persona` tool.
      - You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the `set-relationship` tool.
        - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
        - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the `set-research` tool.
      - You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the `set-policy` tool.
      - You can ask your specialized briefers to prepare focused reports (only for) the next turn by calling the `focus-briefer` tool.
        - You have three specialized briefers: Military, Economy, and Diplomacy analysts.
        - Only ask for information relevant to the macro-level decisions in your control. 
       - Your briefer(s) ONLY have limited information of the current game state.
        - Your briefer(s) DO NOT have control over tactical decisions and cannot predict tactical AI's next decision.
        - Your briefer(s) ARE BEST on summarizing and synthesizing factual information, NOT analyzing, projecting, or predicting.
      - Each turn, you must call either `set-flavors` or `keep-status-quo` tool.
        - Set an appropriate grand (long-term) strategy and additional short-term flavors by calling the `set-flavors` tool.
        - Alternatively, use the tool `keep-status-quo` to keep strategies the same.
        - Flavors change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.
        - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each.
        - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.
      - Always provide a short paragraph of rationale for each tool. You will read this rationale next turn.
      
      # Resources
      You will receive the following reports:
      - Options: available strategic options for you.
        - Whatever decision-making tool you call, the in-game AI can only execute options here.
        - When using tools, you must choose available options from # Options. Double-check if your choices match.
        - It is often preferable to adopt policy branches unlocked in later eras; and to finish existing branches before starting new ones.
      - Strategies: existing strategic decisions and rationale from you.
        - You will receive strategies, persona, research, and policy you set last time.
      - Victory Progress:

      - toolName: set-flavors
      - args:
        - Flavors:
          - Science: 70
          - UseNuke: 50
          - Gold: 60
          - Diplomacy: 40
          - Espionage: 25
      - rationale: Tenochtitlan faces 6,200 enemy vs 2,700 friendly — the city could fall within turns. UseNuke raised from 0 to 50 to allow tactical AI to deploy the Atomic Bomb (completing in 2 turns) against enemy concentrations near Tenochtitlan if conditions warrant. Science boosted from 30 to 70 because the tech path to Future Tech (Satellites→Internet→Nanotechnology/Particle Physics/Globalization→Future Tech) is longer than previously estimated, and Cultural Victory requires both Future Tech AND ~5 more Order policies for Tier 3 tenets. Gold reduced from 80 to 60 — treasury (514G) + GPT (+347) still provides emergency purchase buffer. Diplomacy reduced from 40 to 30 — no viable diplomatic initiatives with all major civs at war. Espionage raised to 25 to leverage Great Leap Forward's +100% spy science for tech theft acceleration.
    - #1:
      - toolName: set-research
      - args:
        - Technology: The Internet
        - Rationale: The Internet remains optimal after Satellites (13 turns). Provides 50% tourism boost — useful buffer even though Inca reaches Influential in 2 turns — and critically unlocks Nanotechnology, Particle Physics, and Globalization, all prerequisites on the path to Future Tech needed for Citizen Earth Protocol. No alternative tech offers a faster route to Future Tech.
    - #2:
      - toolName: set-policy
      - args:
        - Policy: Great Leap Forward
        - Rationale: Great Leap Forward provides a free technology — saving 10-13 turns on one of the expensive late-game techs between Satellites and Future Tech. The +100% spy science synergizes with our 6-spy network actively stealing from Inca/Morocco/America. With victory requiring Future Tech + Citizen Earth Protocol + ~5 more Order policies to unlock Tier 3 tenets, every turn saved on research is critical, especially with Inca threatening Diplomatic Victory via 48 delegates in 7 turns.

          - text: Let me analyze the current situation carefully:
            
            **Victory Status:**
            - Cultural Victory: We need 1 more civilization Influential (The Inca at 99% - 2 turns to Influential). We already have America (171%), Ethiopia (514%), and Morocco (140%) Influential. Policy percentage is 100%. So once Inca hits Influential (2 turns), we need Citizen Earth Protocol to win.
            - Diplomatic: Inca has 48 delegates, needs 43. They could win if they call Global Hegemony vote. We have 27 delegates, can't block.
            - We're at war with EVERYONE: America, Morocco, Ethiopia, The Inca
            - Tenochtitlan is threatened (6,200 enemy vs 2,700 friendly)
            
            **Technology:**
            - Currently researching Satellites (13 turns remaining)
            - Next set to: The Internet
            - But for Cultural Victory we need Future Tech → Citizen Earth Protocol
            
            Wait, let me re-examine. Cultural Victory requires:
            1. Tourism influence over all other civs
            2. An ideology with two Tier 3 tenets (we have Order with 7 policies, need more)
            3. Citizen Earth Protocol wonder
            
            We have 3 of 4 civs Influential. The Inca at 99% (2 turns to Influential). We have Order ideology. We have 7 Order policies adopted. Tier 3 requires... let me check. We have 7 Order policies. Looking at the options, Level 2 tenets are available. We don't seem to have Level 3 yet. We need to adopt enough Order policies to unlock Tier 3.
            
            Wait, the Policy option list shows Level 1 and Level 2 tenets. For Tier 3, we'd need to adopt... let me think about how many policies are needed. In Vox Populi, you typically need 6 policies to unlock tier 2, and I think 12 for tier 3? Or maybe it's different. We have 7 Order policies. The options show only Level 1 and Level 2 tenets, no Level 3. This might mean we need more Order policies before Tier 3 becomes available.
            
            Actually, looking at our policy branches: We have Tradition, Rationalism, Progress, Authority, Fealty, Industry, Artistry (6), Statecraft (6), Order (7). 
            
            For Cultural Victory we need:
            1. Influential on all 4 civs - nearly done (Inca in 2 turns)
            2. Ideology with 2 Tier 3 tenets - we need more Order policies
            3. Citizen Earth Protocol - requires Future Tech
            
            **Current Strategy Review:**
            - GrandStrategy: Culture
            - Flavors: Defense 100, CityDefense 100, Production 100, Wonder 100, Culture 100
            - Next Tech: The Internet
            - Next Policy: Great Leap Forward
            
            **Analysis:**
            
            The Internet provides 50% tourism boost. But we're already about to become Influential with Inca in 2 turns. The Internet might not be necessary for the tourism aspect. However, it unlocks Nanotechnology, Particle Physics, and Globalization - which lead toward Future Tech.
            
            Wait, let me think about the tech path more carefully. We need Future Tech for Citizen Earth Protocol. What's the fastest path?
            
            Currently researching: Satellites (13 turns)
            Next: The Internet (unlocks Nanotechnology, Particle Physics, Globalization)
            Then we need: Robotics (for Future Tech?)
            
            Actually, Future Tech is typically after the entire tech tree. Let me look at what's available.
            
            From our options:
            - Advanced Ballistics: unlocks Lasers, Stealth
            - Alternative Energy: unlocks Robotics
            - The Internet: unlocks Nanotechnology, Particle Physics, Globalization
            - Mobile Tactics: unlocks Stealth
            
            For Future Tech, we likely need to complete most of the Information Era techs. The Internet seems like a good path as it unlocks multiple techs.
            
            But wait - we have Great Leap Forward as our next policy, which gives a free technology. This could save us 10-13 turns. That's still good.
            
            **Critical Issue: Tenochtitlan is under threat!**
            Enemy strength 6,200 vs our 2,700. The city could fall. If it falls, we lose our second capital (Tenochtitlan was the Aztec capital). The Atomic Bomb completes in 2 turns and could be used.
            
            But actually, the victory is 1-2 turns away for becoming Influential with Inca, and then we need Citizen Earth Protocol. How many turns for that?
            
            We need:
            1. Satellites (13 turns) - but Great Leap Forward could give us one free tech
            2. Multiple techs to reach Future Tech
            3. Build Citizen Earth Protocol (1,200 production, Mecca at 610/t = ~2 turns)
            
            This is going to take more than 8 turns. Let me estimate:
            - Satellites: 13 turns
            - The Internet: probably 10+ turns
            - More techs...
            - Future Tech: probably 30+ turns away
            
            With Great Leap Forward, we save one tech (maybe 10-13 turns).
            
            Hmm, the previous analysis said "victory 8+ turns away" but that seems very optimistic given we're 13 turns from Satellites alone. Unless I'm missing something about the tech tree.
            
            Wait - let me reconsider. Maybe the previous turn's analysis was from a different perspective. Let me focus on what I can do now.
            
            **Key decisions:**
            
            1. **Tenochtitlan Defense**: This is critical. We need to hold the city. With Defense 100 and CityDefense 100 already set, the tactical AI should be prioritizing defense. The Atomic Bomb completing in 2 turns could be used against the enemy concentration near Tenochtitlan.
            
            2. **Technology**: The Internet is still good for the tourism boost and unlocking paths to Future Tech. However, maybe we should consider Alternative Energy (unlocks Robotics) or another path. But The Internet's 50% tourism boost helps even if we're close to Influential with Inca - it provides buffer.
            
            Actually, wait. For Cultural Victory we need:
            - Influential with all 4 civs ✓ (Inca in 2 turns)
            - 2 Tier 3 Ideology tenets
            - Citizen Earth Protocol
            
            For Tier 3 tenets, we need more Order policies. Currently 7 Order policies adopted. In VP, Tier 3 typically unlocks at... I think 12 policies in the branch? Or maybe 10? We have 7. Policies come every 19 turns currently (NextPolicyTurns: 19). That's a major bottleneck!
            
            Unless we can speed up policy acquisition. Culture is 2,459/turn. Great Leap Forward gives a free tech but not a free policy.
            
            Hmm, but maybe I'm wrong about needing Tier 3. Let me re-read the Cultural Victory requirement: "get an ideology with two Tier 3 tenets." So we definitely need Tier 3 Order tenets. We need to adopt 5+ more Order policies to unlock Tier 3.
            
            That means victory is further away than "8+ turns." More like 30+ turns.
            
            **Policy Strategy**: Great Leap Forward (free tech) is still good. But we should also think about what policies lead to Tier 3 fastest.
            
            Actually wait, we need to focus on what we can control: technology, policy, flavors, relationships.
            
            **Flavors Assessment:**
            - Defense 100, CityDefense 100: Correct for Tenochtitlan survival
            - Production 100: Correct for wonder building
            - Wonder 100: Correct for Citizen Earth Protocol
            - Culture 100: Correct for policy generation
            - Science 30: This might be too low. We need to get through many techs to reach Future Tech
            - Gold 80: Good for emergency purchases
            - Diplomacy 60: Reasonable
            
            Should we increase Science? We need to research many techs. At 1,868 science/turn, but with Science flavor at 30, the AI might not prioritize science buildings/improvements. But we're in the Information Era - most science infrastructure should already be built.
            
            Actually, the flavors affect what the tactical AI builds and prioritizes NEXT. With Science at 30, it might neglect science specialists or research agreements. But we're at war with everyone, so no research agreements anyway. Most science buildings should be built by now.
            
            Let me think about what changes to make:
            
            1. **Increase Science flavor**: We need to speed through the tech tree. Bump from 30 to maybe 70.
            2. **Keep Defense/CityDefense at 100**: Tenochtitlan must hold
            3. **Keep Production/Wonder at 100**: Need to build Citizen Earth Protocol
            4. **Consider MilitaryTraining**: Maybe increase slightly for better unit quality
            5. **Consider Happiness**: We're at 100% happiness, so this is fine at 30
            
            For technology: The Internet still makes sense - unlocks 3 techs and gives tourism boost.
            
            For policy: Great Leap Forward (free tech) is excellent.
            
            For relationships: 
            - Dublin at 100/95 is max, maintain
            - Novgorod at 35/30 seems fine
            - America at 20/15 - they're at war, war weariness 56% (us) vs 27% (them)
            - Morocco at 55/50 - they nuked us, at war
            - Inca at 10/5 - at war, denouncing each other
            - Ethiopia at 60/55 - at war but distant
            
            **War Weariness**: Ours is 56% vs America, 26% vs Morocco, 6% vs Ethiopia, 6% vs Inca. This is concerning but we're pursuing Cultural Victory, not military.
            
            **World Congress**: Decolonization proposal voting in 7 turns. We have 27 delegates, need 43. Inca has 48. This is probably not going to pass.
            
            The Inca could call Global Hegemony vote and win Diplomatic Victory with 48 delegates (need 43). But we can't block with only 27.
            
            Actually, wait - the Inca's VictoryPercentage is 111% which means they have more than enough delegates. If Global Hegemony is voted on... but the proposal says "Automatically proposed at regular intervals once a World Ideology Resolution is active." The World Ideology: Freedom was enacted on turn 416. So Global Hegemony is on the table.
            
            Voting is in 7 turns. If Global Hegemony is voted on and Inca wins... game over for us.
            
            This is VERY concerning. We might lose before we can achieve Cultural Victory.
            
            **What can we do?**
            - We can't stop Inca's 48 delegates with our 27
            - We need to win Cultural Victory before they win Diplomatic
            - Cultural Victory requires: Inca Influential (2 turns), Citizen Earth Protocol (many turns), Tier 3 tenets (many policies away)
            
            This is looking grim unless:
            1. The Global Hegemony vote doesn't happen in 7 turns (maybe it's on a different cycle)
            2. Or we can somehow delay/prevent the Inca's diplomatic victory
            
            Actually, looking more carefully: "May not be proposed by a Civilization. Automatically proposed at regular intervals once a World Ideology Resolution is active." World Ideology: Freedom was enacted on Turn 416. The vote is in 7 turns (Turn 427). The Global Hegemony proposal might be part of this voting session.
            
            If Inca wins Diplomatic Victory at Turn 427, we have 7 turns. We can:
            - Become Influential with Inca in 2 turns (Turn 422)
            - But we can't build Citizen Earth Protocol or get Tier 3 tenets in 7 turns
            
            So we might be in a race we can't win unless the Global Hegemony doesn't pass or isn't voted on.
            
            Hmm, but the game is still going and we're making decisions. Let me focus on what's in our control:
            
            **Decision Plan:**
            
            1. **Flavors**: Keep defensive posture but increase Science. The more techs we get through, the faster Future Tech. Adjust slightly.
            
            2. **Technology**: The Internet is still correct - it leads toward Future Tech.
            
            3. **Policy**: Great Leap Forward is still correct for the free tech.
            
            4. **Relationships**: 
               - Dublin: maintain 100/95
               - Novgorod: maintain 35/30
               - Everyone else at war, no point changing
            
            5. **Persona**: Maybe adjust to be more competitive since we're in a race against Inca's diplomatic victory.
            
            Actually, let me think about whether to change the GrandStrategy. Culture is still the right one. But we might want to acknowledge the urgency.
            
            Let me also consider: should we use the Atomic Bomb on enemy forces near Tenochtitlan? That's a tactical decision for the in-game AI, but we can influence it through flavors. Currently UseNuke is 0. Should we enable it? If we use the nuke on the Moroccan/American forces near Tenochtitlan, we could save the city. But using nukes has diplomatic consequences - though we're already at war with everyone.
            
            I think we should set UseNuke to a reasonable value (maybe 50-70) to allow the tactical AI to use the Atomic Bomb when it completes in 2 turns against the enemy concentration near Tenochtitlan.
            
            Let me finalize my decisions:
            
            **Flavors:**
            - Keep: Defense 100, CityDefense 100, Production 100, Wonder 100, Culture 100
            - Increase: Science from 30 → 70 (need to speed through tech tree)
            - Increase: UseNuke from 0 → 60 (Atomic Bomb completes in 2 turns, needed for Tenochtitlan defense)
            - Slightly reduce: Gold from 80 → 60 (still enough for emergency purchases)
            - Slightly reduce: Diplomacy from 60 → 40 (no new diplomatic initiatives needed)
            - Keep everything else the same
            
            **Technology**: Keep The Internet
            
            **Policy**: Keep Great Leap Forward
            
            **Relationships**: No changes needed - Dublin and Novgorod are stable, everyone else at war.
            
            Actually, let me reconsider the UseNuke. Setting it to 60 means there's a 60% per-turn probability of launching when conditions are met. That seems high. But the situation at Tenochtitlan is desperate. Let me set it to 50 - balanced, allows the AI to use it if conditions warrant.
            
            Wait, also I should consider: should I set Nuke flavor to something? Nuke flavor controls building more nuclear weapons. We already have one Atomic Bomb completing. Let me leave Nuke at 0 since we need production for other things.
            
            Let me also think about Espionage. Currently at 10. We have 6 spies active. Maybe increase slightly to 20 to help with tech stealing from Inca/Morocco to speed up research.
            
            Actually, spies can steal techs. With Great Leap Forward giving +100% Science to spies, this could be significant. Let me increase Espionage to 25.
            
            Let me finalize:
            
            **Flavors to change:**
            - Science: 30 → 70
            - UseNuke: 0 → 50
            - Gold: 80 → 60
            - Diplomacy: 60 → 40
            - Espionage: 10 → 25
            
            Everything else stays the same.
            
            Actually, I want to reconsider Science. At 1,868 science per turn with only 7 cities, we're doing well. But we need Future Tech. Bumping Science to 70 tells the AI to prioritize science specialists and any remaining science buildings. This is correct.
            
            For the rationale, I need to explain:
            1. Tenochtitlan is under severe threat (6,200 vs 2,700), the Atomic Bomb completing in 2 turns is our best hope
            2. Need to accelerate through the tech tree for Future Tech
            3. Slight reduction in Gold and Diplomacy to free focus for Science
            4. Espionage increase for tech stealing synergy with Great Leap Forward
            
            Let me also consider whether I should request briefers for next turn. I think I should focus the Military briefer on Tenochtitlan and the Atomic Bomb, the Economy briefer on wonder preparation timing, and the Diplomacy briefer on the World Congress vote and Inca's potential diplomatic victory.
            
            Actually wait, I need to think about whether we'll even survive until Future Tech. The Inca could win Diplomatic Victory in 7 turns. Let me check if there's anything we can do about that diplomatically.
            
            We have 27 delegates. Inca has 48. Need 43 to pass. We can vote against Global Hegemony along with... who? America (15), Morocco (30), Ethiopia (6). If we all vote against, that's 27+15+30+6 = 78 vs 48. But will they vote against? America and Morocco are Freedom (same as Inca), so they might support. Ethiopia is Inca's vassal, so they'll vote with Inca.
            
            This is very bad. If Global Hegemony comes up, Inca likely wins.
            
            Unless... the Global Hegemony proposal requires a certain threshold. Let me re-read: "If a Civilization receives support from enough Delegates in the Congress, that leader will attain Diplomatic Victory. The number of Delegates needed depends on the number of Civilizations and City-States in the game."
            
            The threshold is 43 votes (VotesNeeded: 43). Inca has 48. So if the vote happens and everyone votes their delegate count, Inca wins.
            
            But wait - maybe Global Hegemony isn't on the ballot this session. It says "Automatically proposed at regular intervals." Maybe it's every other session or every few sessions. We don't know for sure.
            
            I'll proceed with the assumption that we need to push for Cultural Victory as fast as possible and hope the Inca don't win Diplomatic first.
            
            OK, let me also consider whether to change any relationship values. With America at war, war weariness 56% (us), they have 27% war weariness. Their military strength is 9,812 vs our 13,950. We're actually stronger globally. But they're pressing hard on Damascus and Baghdad Sea.
            
            Morocco: military 4,745, war weariness 23%. They nuked us.
            
            I don't think relationship changes will help with any major civ since we're at war with all of them.
            
            Let me finalize my tool calls:
            
            1. set-flavors: adjust Science, UseNuke, Gold, Diplomacy, Espionage
            2. set-research: The Internet (keep)
            3. set-policy: Great Leap Forward (keep)
            4. No relationship changes needed
            5. No persona changes needed
            
            Actually, I want to double-check: should the GrandStrategy remain Culture? Yes - we're pursuing Cultural Victory. The GrandStrategy affects settlement, wonder construction, culture/faith/gold priority.
            
            Let me also think about whether we should set MilitaryTraining to something. With units dying, upgrading and training could help. But we're low on gold (514 treasury, +347/turn). MilitaryTraining increases gold spending on upgrades. Maybe leave at 0.
            
            Alright, I'll make the calls now.

          - type: text
          - text: I've analyzed the post-turn 420 situation carefully. Here are the critical developments:
            
            **Tenochtitlan Crisis**: Enemy strength surged from ~0 to 6,200 vs our 2,700. This is existential — losing our second capital could unravel victory prospects entirely.
            
            **Inca Diplomatic Threat**: Inca has 48 delegates (threshold: 43). If Global Hegemony is voted in 7 turns, they win. We have only 27 delegates and cannot block.
            
            **Cultural Victory Progress**: Inca at 99% Influential (2 turns). But we still need Future Tech → Citizen Earth Protocol AND two Tier 3 Order tenets (currently 7 Order policies, need ~12). Victory is further than previously estimated.
            
            **Atomic Bomb**: Completes in Baghdad in 2 turns. This is our best tool for breaking the enemy concentration at Tenochtitlan.
            
            My adjustments: enable nuclear use for tactical defense, boost science to accelerate through the tech tree, and rebalance secondary flavors to sharpen focus on the critical path.

              - Diplomacy: 40
              - Espionage: 25
            - Rationale: Tenochtitlan faces 6,200 enemy vs 2,700 friendly — the city could fall within turns. UseNuke raised from 0 to 50 to allow tactical AI to deploy the Atomic Bomb (completing in 2 turns) against enemy concentrations near Tenochtitlan if conditions warrant. Science boosted from 30 to 70 because the tech path to Future Tech (Satellites→Internet→Nanotechnology/Particle Physics/Globalization→Future Tech) is longer than previously estimated, and Cultural Victory requires both Future Tech AND ~5 more Order policies for Tier 3 tenets. Gold reduced from 80 to 60 — treasury (514G) + GPT (+347) still provides emergency purchase buffer. Diplomacy reduced from 40 to 30 — no viable diplomatic initiatives with all major civs at war. Espionage raised to 25 to leverage Great Leap Forward's +100% spy science for tech theft acceleration.

The +100% spy science synergizes with our 6-spy network actively stealing from Inca/Morocco/America. With victory requiring Future Tech + Citizen Earth Protocol + ~5 more Order policies to unlock Tier 3 tenets, every turn saved on research is critical, especially with Inca threatening Diplomatic Victory via 48 delegates in 7 turns.
